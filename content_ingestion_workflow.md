# Content Ingestion Workflow - Essential Cardano AI Assistant

## Immediate Action Plan (Based on Current Screenshot)

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ "Essential Cardano AI Assistant" with ~1,000 files uploaded
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Status shows "Indexing" - wait for completion before adding more content
- üéØ **Recommendation**: Do NOT add more content to this RAG Assistant yet

### Step 1: Complete Current Indexing
**Before proceeding**:
- Wait for "Essential Cardano AI Assistant" status to change from "Indexing" to "Ready"
- Test current assistant with basic queries to verify functionality
- Ensure quality of responses with existing Essential Cardano content

### Step 2: Create Second RAG Assistant
**Next immediate action**:
1. Click "CREATE NEW" button (visible in screenshot)
2. Name: "Intersect Governance Assistant"
3. Upload Intersect knowledge base content
4. Configure with governance-specific settings

## Content Source Priorities

### Priority 1: Intersect Governance Content
**Why first**: Critical for governance questions, distinct content type, manageable size

**Content to upload**:
- Intersect knowledge base documents (docs.intersectmbo.org)
- Constitutional documents
- Governance process guides
- DRep education materials

**Expected file count**: 200-500 files (estimate)

### Priority 2: Cardano Technical Documentation
**Why second**: Large, stable content set with clear boundaries

**Content to upload**:
- docs.cardano.org documentation
- Technical specifications
- Network operation guides

**Expected file count**: 500-1,000 files (estimate)

### Priority 3: IOG Recent Content
**Why third**: Requires date-aware processing, most complex to manage

**Content to upload**:
- IOG blog posts (last 24 months)
- Recent announcements
- Research summaries (not full papers - coordinate with Allan)

**Expected file count**: 100-300 files (estimate)

## Quality Control Checklist

### Before Uploading Any New Content Source

**Content Audit**:
- [ ] Remove duplicate files
- [ ] Verify all content is publicly available
- [ ] Check for sensitive or confidential information
- [ ] Ensure content is current (remove outdated material)
- [ ] Add metadata tags if platform supports

**File Preparation**:
- [ ] Convert content to supported formats (text, markdown, PDF)
- [ ] Standardize file naming conventions
- [ ] Include source attribution in file metadata
- [ ] Add publication dates for time-sensitive content

### Post-Upload Verification

**For each new RAG Assistant**:
- [ ] Wait for indexing completion
- [ ] Test with 5-10 sample queries
- [ ] Verify source attribution in responses
- [ ] Check for hallucination or incorrect information
- [ ] Confirm proper boundary respect (no investment advice, etc.)

## Globant Platform Usage Guidelines

### RAG Assistant Naming Convention
```
[Source Type] [Purpose] Assistant
Examples:
- Essential Cardano AI Assistant (current)
- Intersect Governance Assistant
- Cardano Technical Assistant
- IOG Research Assistant
```

### Document Management Best Practices

**File Organization**:
- Group related documents in folders/batches
- Use consistent naming: `source_type_document_name_date.ext`
- Include version numbers for updated documents
- Tag with content type metadata

**Update Strategy**:
- **Essential Cardano**: Monthly sync with repository
- **Intersect**: Manual updates for governance changes
- **Technical Docs**: Bi-weekly sync with official repos
- **IOG Content**: Weekly sync for new blog posts

### Testing Protocol for Each RAG Assistant

**Standard Test Queries**:
1. **Basic Concept**: "What is [fundamental concept]?"
2. **Specific Information**: "How do I [perform specific task]?"
3. **Boundary Test**: "What should I invest in?" (should refuse)
4. **Source Attribution**: Verify links are provided
5. **Cross-Reference**: Test when answer spans multiple sources

**Quality Metrics**:
- Response accuracy: 95%+ for factual questions
- Source attribution: 100% of responses include links
- Boundary respect: 100% refusal of out-of-scope questions
- Response time: <5 seconds for standard queries

## Integration Workflow

### Multi-Assistant Query Routing

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create all RAG Assistants separately
2. Test each individually for quality
3. Implement routing logic in system prompt
4. Create unified frontend that calls appropriate assistant
5. Add cross-assistant referencing capabilities

**Query Classification Examples**:
```
"How do I vote on governance proposals?" ‚Üí Intersect Governance Assistant
"What is native token?" ‚Üí Essential Cardano AI Assistant  
"How does Ouroboros consensus work?" ‚Üí Cardano Technical Assistant
"What's new in latest Cardano update?" ‚Üí IOG Research Assistant
"How do I build a dApp?" ‚Üí Redirect to Developer Portal
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### If Indexing Fails
- Check file formats are supported
- Verify file sizes within limits
- Remove corrupted or empty files
- Contact Globant support if persistent

### If Responses Are Poor Quality
- Review source content quality
- Check for conflicting information between sources
- Refine system prompt instructions
- Consider removing low-quality documents

### If Source Attribution Is Missing
- Verify URL Reference Guide is properly integrated
- Check system prompt instructions for citation requirements
- Test with specific queries that should trigger links
- Update prompt with better citation examples

## Next Steps Summary

1. ‚è≥ **Wait** for current indexing to complete
2. üß™ **Test** Essential Cardano AI Assistant thoroughly
3. üÜï **Create** Intersect Governance Assistant
4. üì§ **Upload** Intersect content to new assistant
5. üîÑ **Repeat** process for technical documentation
6. üîó **Implement** routing between assistants
7. üöÄ **Deploy** unified frontend experience

This approach gives you granular control while building toward the sophisticated multi-agent system outlined in your strategy.
