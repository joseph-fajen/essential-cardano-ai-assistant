Cardano Forum and Reddit\n\n[Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/) is an online discussion forum for the global Cardano community run by the community with assistance from Cardano Foundation members and official Cardano ambassadors. It is available in ten different languages.\n\nThere are more than 300,000 all-time posts and more than 30,000 different topics spanning everything from technical to non-technical discussions about Cardano. As there are many opinions on the forum, one should use discretion.\n\nReddit is a platform for different communities and sub-communities that cover a variety of topics, interests, and niches.\n\n[Cardano’s Reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/) has over 690,000 members and numerous topics and posts to browse through. The quality of posts and information can vary according to the topic and user so one should use the information provided at their discretion.\n\n## 2. EMURGO Communities on Twitter and Discord\n\n[Click here to join the EMURGO Community on Discord](https://discord.gg/MaqxHZbhyd)\n\n[Follow EMURGO on Twitter](https://twitter.com/emurgo_io)\n\n[Join EMURGO Academy on Discord](https://discord.gg/beTSe5Sky4)\n\n[Join the EMURGO Academy community on Telegram](https://t.me/+tyN_Jc1yKxtjMzM1)\n\nFollowing EMURGO on Twitter and joining the EMURGO Community on Discord is a couple of the best ways to get daily information about Cardano from one of the founding entities of Cardano.\n\nIn it, people can find information about EMURGO-related products & services including $USDA stablecoin, Yoroi Wallet, EMURGO Ventures, and others.\n\nThe EMURGO Discord community is where people can also share about their Cardano-focused projects.\n\nFor Cardano developers and those interested in the technical aspects of the Cardano blockchain, EMURGO Academy’s community channels are excellent for communication.\n\nIn the EMURGO Academy channels above, blockchain projects can meet some of the brightest EMURGO Academy graduates proficient in Cardano blockchain development and network for developers and other talented blockchain professionals.\n\nEMURGO Academy also hosts regular events around the funding rounds of Project Catalyst, Cardano blockchain’s decentralized governance and funding platform.\n\nIn those events, blockchain project founders can showcase their ideas, development progress, and team to promote themselves to the overall Cardano community.\n\n## 3. IOG Technical Channel\n\n[Click here to access the IOG Technical Channel](https://discord.gg/inputoutput)\n\nOne of the best places to get started as a Cardano developer is the IOG (Input Output Global) Technical Channel on Discord.\n\nIt is the official source for technical updates from IOG and technical updates about the Cardano blockchain.\n\nMany of the people working at IOG frequent the Discord channel to answer community member questions. It also has dedicated community moderators to help new people.\n\nIt’s one of the best sources of technical information.\n\n## 4. Project Catalyst\n\n[Join the Cardano Project Catalyst channel on Discord](https://discord.gg/ztGKc6QhhX)\n\nProject Catalyst is one of the most dynamic communities on Cardano and is the name for the decentralized funding mechanism in which Cardano dApp projects can make funding proposals and let the Cardano community vote for those that will receive grants.\n\nThese funding rounds last three months.\n\nThrough nine different Project Catalyst funding rounds to date, 1,155 projects have been funded with more than [$25 million in total funding distributed](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bfnWFa94Y7Zj0G7dtpo9W1nAYGovJbswipxiHT4UE3g/edit#gid=312662175).\n\nProject Catalyst is one of the best ways to receive seed funding for a Cardano project, voted on by ADA holders.\n\nBut to be successful when proposing, it’s important to be a part of the community.\n\nThe Discord channel has constant events, educational sessions around how to propose, and many other activities to help future Cardano dApp projects.\n\n## 5. GimbaLabs\n\n[Join GimbaLabs on Discord](https://discord.gg/RU9Gk8TrbY)\n\n[Follow GimbaLabs on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gimbalabs)\n\nGimbaLabs is an education-based project that came out of Project Catalyst.\n\nThey are one of the most active communities in the Cardano ecosystem and offer excellent information about many of the different aspects of the network.\n\nThe project has educational content around project-based learning for Cardano dApps. It is also preparing content around blockchain tokenomics, and other topics crucial for the blockchain industry.\n\n## 6. Cardano NFT communities\n\nNFTs have been a catalyst for the growth of different communities in the Cardano ecosystem as well as a big factor in much of Cardano’s actual on-chain transaction volume. [NFTs or non-fungible tokens](https://emurgo.io/emurgo-academy-nfts-blockchain-metadata-and-cnfts/) enable artists, musicians, and creative brands to have unique digital representations of their original works in digital token (crypto) form that can be easily transacted over the Internet via an NFT marketplace and provide ownership rights.\n\nTo date, there have been approximately 57 million Cardano transactions recorded.\n\nThere are several leading Cardano NFT communities online with an increasing number of users and a variety of Cardano NFT marketplaces where users can buy or sell unique Cardano NFT collections.\n\n[More: What are NFTs?](https://emurgo.io/emurgo-academy-nfts-blockchain-metadata-and-cnfts/)\n\n## Special Mention: Cardano Spot\n\n[Join Cardano Spot now](https://cardanospot.io/landing)\n\n[Follow Cardano Spot on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/cardanospot)\n\nCardano Spot is a newly launched social network and information platform for the Cardano community developed by Cardano founding entity EMURGO.\n\nCardano Spot provides a user-generated interactive platform specifically designed for investment in, distribution, consumption, and monetization of Cardano content.\n\nCardano Spot’s platform solves the issue of fragmented content in the Cardano ecosystem by aggregating useful content from trusted sources in the Cardano ecosystem to give updates about developments in the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nAt the moment the project is in beta, and there is a waiting list for those looking to start joining its community.\n\n## Follow EMURGO and our business units to stay updated with all that's happening in our ecosystem\n\nWant to stay updated on all of the above?\n\nThen, follow us on Twitter [@emurgo\\_io](http://twitter.com/emurgo_io) and our various business units’ official channels below for a simple way to stay connected and learn everything you need to know.\n\n**About EMURGO**\n\nOfficial Homepage: [emurgo.io](//emurgo.io)\n\nTwitter (Global): [@EMURGO\\_io](https://twitter.com/emurgo_io)\n\nYouTube: [EMURGO channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFQ0hHuPO1QDcyP6t9KZTQ)\n\nDiscord: [EMURGO Community](https://discord.com/invite/AWEp2SG437)\n\nFacebook: [@](https://www.facebook.com/emurgo.io/)[EMURGO.io](//EMURGO.io)\n\nInstagram: [@EMURGO\\_io](https://www.instagram.com/emurgo_io/)\n\nLinkedIn: [@EMURGO\\_io](https://www.linkedin.com/company/emurgo_io/)\n\n**About USDA**\n\nOfficial Homepage: [anzens.com](//anzens.com)\n\nTwitter: [@AnzensOfficial](http://twitter.com/anzensofficial)\n\n**About Cardano Spot**\n\nOfficial Homepage: [cardanospot.io](//cardanospot.io)\n\nTwitter: [@CardanoSpot](http://twitter.com/cardanospot)\n\nTelegram: <https://t.me/cardanospot>\n\nContact: [cardanospot@emurgo.io](mailto:cardanospot@emurgo.io)\n\n**About Yoroi Wallet**\n\nYoroi Twitter: [@YoroiWallet](https://twitter.com/YoroiWallet)\n\nOfficial Website: [yoroi-wallet.com](//yoroi-wallet.com)\n\n**About EMURGO Middle East & Africa**\n\nOfficial Homepage: [emurgo.africa](https://emurgo.africa/)\n\nTwitter: [@EmurgoAfrica](https://twitter.com/EmurgoAfrica)\n\nTelegram: <https://t.me/emurgoafrica>\n\n**About EMURGO Academy**\n\nOfficial Homepage: [education.emurgo.io](//education.emurgo.io)\n\nTwitter: [@emurgo\\_in](https://twitter.com/emurgo_in)\n\nFacebook: [@Emurgoacademy](https://www.facebook.com/Emurgoacademy)\n\nInstagram: [@emurgoacademy](https://www.instagram.com/emurgoacademy)\n\nLinkedIn: [@emurgo-in](https://www.linkedin.com/company/emurgo-in)\n\nDiscord: [EMURGO Academy Community](https://discord.gg/zbR2Y2CwAr)\n\nTelegram:[EMURGO Academy](https://t.me/+tyN_Jc1yKxtjMzM1)\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/00de493b-a32e-409a-8c08-277c85f4b809/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this article?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
