As a result, Andamio enables new modes of collaboration across a network of people and organizations.\n\nAndamio's mission is to support people to learn, organize, and share information enough to solve big problems. Andamio is built for anyone who wants to learn enough to contribute to breakthrough projects, and it is built for organizations seeking new ways to collaborate by sharing resources and decentralizing decision-making power.\n\n**Details**\n\n**When**: Tuesday 2023-10-17 at 1800 UTC\n\n**Where**: Register here: <https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZYoduuqpjsqGtdzMHXoRVVnJqcQGOtpQRQv> (+ subscribe to Gimbalabs Calendar for future events: <https://gimbalabs.com/calendar>)\n\n**Who**: everyone is welcome to participate actively or simply to listen.\n\n**Agenda**\n\n1800 - 1815: Welcome + About Playground1815 - 1930: Presentation + Discussion: Andamio Platform\n\n*Do you wanna present at the Playground? go to our new Miro Board:* <https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMnYs6P8=/?moveToWidget=3458764563494604015&cot=14>\n\nAll the best + see you soon!\n\nSebastian\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/525aaddb-0680-430e-9e83-696922568ba4/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this article?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
