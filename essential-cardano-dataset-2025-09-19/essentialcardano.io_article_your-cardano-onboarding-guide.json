No worries, here’s a list of essentials to get you started\n\n*Disclaimer: Nothing in this article is intended to be professional advice, including without limitation, financial, investment, legal or tax advice. IO Global is not responsible for your use of or reliance on any information in this article.*\n\nBlockchain is one of the most influential technologies of the 21st century. It provides solutions for more efficient business processes, data traceability, and, of course, decentralized digital payments.\n\nThe platform’s evolution has attracted massive amounts of new users into the Cardano ecosystem. Specifically, Cardano has delivered some of the most promising features that position the platform as a secure and versatile environment for application development and enterprise deployment.\n\nHowever, despite the increasing numbers joining the space, getting onboard remains challenging for the average user. Onboarding often involves complex processes that lack visibility or clear information for the new user.\n\n## Getting started with Cardano\n\nSo let’s say you heard about the benefits of blockchain technology and about Cardano in particular. You’re now interested to see how it works and how you can benefit from it. Where to start? To streamline your Cardano journey, we have compiled a list of essential resources and some tips to get you started.\n\n### Learn some basics\n\nLet’s start with the blockchain basics:\n\n[What is a blockchain?](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-is-a-blockchain-d9c55eda)\n\n[What is a cryptocurrency?](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-is-a-cryptocurrency)\n\n[What is consensus?](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-is-consensus-297d889a)\n\n[What is proof of stake?](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-is-proof-of-stake-pos-cd1c7d7f)\n\nNow that you know how a blockchain works and what a cryptocurrency is, it is time to learn more about Cardano.\n\nCardano aims to provide an opportunity for global communities to easily access and use the blockchain in their daily lives. Using blockchain, you can, for example, send funds to your friends, pay for products or services, or use decentralized applications (DApps). Yet, blockchain is much more than just a financial system. But first things first, here is everything you need to know about Cardano:\n\nYou can also go over [Essential Cardano FAQs](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq) or [‘New to Cardano’ section on Cardano Docs](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/new-to-cardano) to learn more about Ouroboros, ada, and what makes Cardano a third-generation blockchain:\n\n[What is Cardano?](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-is-cardano-c1f9aef2)\n\n[What makes Cardano a third-generation blockchain?](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-makes-cardano-a-third-generation-blockchain-c8fddfbc)\n\n[How does Cardano work?](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/how-does-cardano-work-ad9564bd)\n\n[What is Ouroboros?](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-is-ouroboros-5c79f8a1)\n\n[Why is Cardano called the ‘green blockchain’?](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/why-is-cardano-called-the-green-blockchain-9c0d2b6f)\n\n### Getting involved\n\nHaving read about the basics, you’re now ready to try Cardano out.\n\nLet’s start with some simple payments. You will first need to choose and create a Cardano [wallet](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-wallet-266a088e) and get some [ada](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-is-ada-whats-in-a-name-b4b35d34).\n\nExplore different **Cardano** wallet products and get the one that best suits your needs.\n\nHere is an article on the various types of cryptocurrency wallets and examples of wallet products/providers for Cardano to choose from: [Types of wallets](https://docs.cardano.org/new-to-cardano/types-of-wallets).\n\n**For desktop**: [Lace](https://www.lace.io/) is a simplified desktop wallet perfect for first-time users. [Eternl](https://eternl.io/app/mainnet/welcome) and [Typhon](https://typhonwallet.io/) are more advanced desktop wallets with a number of interesting features.\n\n**For mobile:** [Vespr](https://vespr.xyz/), [Eternl](https://linktr.ee/eternlwallet), and [Gero](https://gerowallet.io/) are some go-to options that are largely adopted by the community.\n\nExplore and choose a cryptocurrency exchange (in your jurisdiction) to get some ada.\n\nTry out the wallet: ask a fellow Cardano community member for their wallet address and try exchanging (sending/receiving) small amounts of ada with them.\n\nYou're now a Cardano user experiencing the world of Web3 and crypto! You can track your transactions and account activities using [Cardano explorers](http://explorer.cardano.org). Learn how to use the tracking tools to do this: [Cardano tracking tools](https://docs.cardano.org/new-to-cardano/cardano-tracking-tools).\n\n**Understanding staking and delegation**\n\nAs an ada holder, you own a stake that is the amount of ada you have. This means that you are now part of the Cardano network and can help maintain it. A developer or a tech-savvy person can set up a stake pool and run it to help verify transactions, create blocks, and get rewards.\n\nIf you are not interested in running your own pool, you can instead choose to delegate your stake to an existing pool and share its rewards. There is no risk to this as no ada leaves your wallet and you can spend your funds at anytime while they are delegated to a stake pool.\n\nAda holders can delegate stake using their wallets. Here are some useful articles to review:\n\n[How to choose a stake pool](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900002174303-How-to-choose-a-stake-pool)\n\n[How safe is it to delegate to a stake pool?](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900002046123-How-safe-is-it-to-delegate-to-a-stake-pool)\n\n[How to delegate to a stake pool](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005718683-How-to-Delegate-to-a-stake-pool) using Daedalus\n\n[Staking and delegating for beginners](https://forum.cardano.org/t/staking-and-delegating-for-beginners-a-step-by-step-guide/36681) (Daedalus)\n\n[The general perspective on staking in Cardano](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/11/13/the-general-perspective-on-staking-in-cardano/)\n\n[How to stake your ada](https://www.essentialcardano.io/infographic/how-to-stake-your-ada).\n\n**Getting started with governance**\n\nOne of the many distinguishing features of Cardano is its implementation of Cardano Improvement Proposal #1694 ([CIP-1694](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-1694)), which laid the foundation for a more decentralized and community-driven decision-making process. Named after the birth year of the philosopher Voltaire, this proposal marks the transition to the [Voltaire development phase](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/voltaire/), where governance is self-sustaining and controlled by the Cardano community.\n\nCIP-1694 introduces a tripartite governance structure consisting of delegated representatives (DReps), the constitutional committee (CC), and stake pool operators (SPOs). These bodies work together to review and approve governance actions, which can be submitted by anyone, ensuring a transparent and democratic process.\n\nYou can learn more about:\n\nTo fully participate in decentralized decision-making, start with:\n\nAs a minimum, you should start by [delegating your stake](https://docs.gov.tools/cardano-govtool/using-govtool/delegating) to a DRep so that the voting power of your stake can influence Cardano’s direction.\n\n**Being part of innovation**\n\nProject Catalyst is one of the world’s largest decentralized innovation funds, where ada holders can vote on the most promising projects to get funded from the treasury.\n\nThere are many ways to get involved with Project Catalyst – as an innovator, voter, commenter, proposer, proposal reviewer, community advisor, or even a mentor. The first step is [creating an account](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/cardano/landing) on the Catalyst collaboration platform, IdeaScale.\n\nFind out more:\n\n[Project Catalyst website](https://projectcatalyst.io/)\n\n[Project Catalyst and Voltaire bring power to the people](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/09/10/project-catalyst-voltaire-bring-power-to-the-people/)\n\n[Project Catalyst Innovation](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/05/10/project-catalyst-a-virtuous-cycle-of-cardano-ecosystem-development-investing-in-great-ideas-to-make-positive-real-world-changes/)\n\n[Cardano Catalyst community site](https://cardanocataly.st/).\n\n### Ready for more? Discover decentralized finance (DeFi)\n\nDecentralized finance or DeFi is a blockchain-based form of finance that addresses the same needs as traditional finance. The goal of DeFi is to help individuals and companies engage in financial activity without going through a central, expensive middleman such as a bank.\n\nThe DeFi explainer unpacks the complexity of some blockchain notions. Head over and take a look at what terms like DeFi, RealFi, DApp, DEX, liquidity, and so on mean:\n\nYou can now experiment with some DApps. Just like a mobile app runs on your iOS or Android device, a Cardano DApp runs on the Cardano blockchain. There are various categories of DApps, from gaming and health to finance and government applications.\n\nThere are a number of community-driven resources gathering information about the latest projects launched on Cardano:\n\n[CardanoCube](https://www.cardanocube.io/cardano-ecosystem-interactive-map)\n\n[Built on Cardano](https://builtoncardano.com/)\n\n[AdaPulse](https://adapulse.io/)\n\n[LIDO NATION](https://www.lidonation.com/en).\n\n### Non-fungible tokens\n\nEvery ada is the same as another. You can trade one ada for another and get the same value i.e. 1:1; this means that ada is fungible.\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs), on the other hand, are unique and can carry special information (metadata) that represents digital ownership rights of real-world and digital assets such as a real-estate or a 3D animation. Anyone can create their own NFTs on Cardano [natively](https://docs.cardano.org/native-tokens/learn) with minimal work without a smart contract. This is a huge difference from the error-prone complexity found on Ethereum, for example. This makes Cardano NFTs more secure, cheaper, and faster to transact with.\n\nNFTs have been booming recently. You can create, buy, and sell digital representations of anything - drawings, video clips, music, tweets, articles, trading cards, game items, and more. Make sure to explore:\n\n[Cardano NFTs: everything you need to know](https://www.cada.news/cardano-nfts/#2-what-are-the-cardano-nfts-or-the-non-fungible-tokens)\n\n[JPG Store: Cardano NFT marketplace](https://www.jpg.store/)\n\n[Cardano cube: NFT projects](https://www.cardanocube.io/collections/nft)\n\n[NMKR](https://www.nmkr.io/)\n\n[TapTools](https://www.taptools.io/?currency=ADA).\n\n### What do you need to know about smart contracts?\n\nSmart contracts are programs that run on blockchains to perform complex (and simple) tasks. You can think of them as sophisticated ATMs or vending machines. Smart contracts act as digital agreements that track, verify, and execute the binding parts of a deal between various parties. The contract stages are automatically executed when predetermined conditions are met.\n\nAs a beginner, you don’t need to dive straight into how to write a smart contract. What’s important to know is that DApps use smart contracts for you to experience safe deal execution.\n\nCardano provides the possibility to work with different [smart contract languages](https://docs.cardano.org/developer-resources/welcome#smart-contracts).\n\nIf you’re interested in learning how to write Plutus contracts, you can participate in the [Plutus Pioneer](https://docs.cardano.org/pioneer-programs/plutus-pioneers) program.\n\n### Digital identity\n\nIdentity is key to accessing a range of private and public services. From opening a bank account to obtaining loans or a driver's license, access to education, etc, the need to prove to others who we are is almost omnipresent in everyday life.\n\nLearn more:\n\n### Continue exploring\n\nTo conclude, we should state that this is just the beginning.
