You will also loose any pending rewards for participating in Project Catalyst voting. By following these steps you will be able to receive your pending rewards and transfer all of your ₳ to your new wallet.\n\nLeaving 1 ₳ in your wallet, send everything else including all of your Cardano Native Tokens, NFTs etc to your new wallet. This small amount of ₳ that you left in your wallet will be used to pay transaction fees later.\n\nDelegate your new wallet to a stake pool straight away to ensure you don't miss out on any staking rewards.\n\nWait three epoch boundaries (or 15 days) for your pending stake rewards to arrive in your wallet. If you have recently voted in Project Catalyst you may want to wait until you have also received your voting rewards.\n\nClaim your remaining rewards and unstake or deregister your stake key to receive your 2 ₳ stake key deposit that you paid when you registered your stake key.\n\nSend all of the remaining ₳ to your new wallet.\n\nYou may want to keep your old wallet set up or keep hold of your seed phrase in case you need access to the information for tax purposes.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AGNmyxYhHqN7z57OXbxLfyPSsaH78O3Ua22jFrnzJtG_=s96-c)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this FAQ?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
