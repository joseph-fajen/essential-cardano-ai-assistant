What can I do with ada?\n\nMining ada isn't possible because mining is the feature of proof-of-work blockchains. On Cardano, owners can [stake and delegate](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-is-staking-and-delegation-on-cardano) ada to earn rewards. By delegating their stake, users help run the Cardano blockchain. All rewards are distributed in ada every 5 days.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this FAQ?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
