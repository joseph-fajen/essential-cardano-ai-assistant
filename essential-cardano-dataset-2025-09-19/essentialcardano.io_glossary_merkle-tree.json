The Merkle tree allows a block of transactions to be generated in a single hash, which is used to verify its validity to the original set of transactions. Using hashes is time efficient and does not require the validation of every transaction from the chain history.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
