CIP-1694 defines the CC as a committee that represents a set of individuals or entities that are collectively responsible for ensuring that the constitution's principles are upheld and enforced.\n\nAs described in CIP-1694, each Constitutional Committee (CC) member has one vote, adhering to a “one member, one vote” principle. CC members are responsible for reviewing whether governance actions align with the Cardano constitution. The CC must meet a specific quorum defined by a protocol parameter to pass a governance action.\n\nCC members may vote on any governance action and decide if it goes against the constitution. The CC cannot modify governance actions once presented for a vote. The CC will be initially instituted for the first interaction with members of the Cardano community and evolve as the governance model advances.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158074695?v=4)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
