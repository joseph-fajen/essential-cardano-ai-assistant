The assets may be a ‘basket’ of currencies, a single currency (eg, the US dollar or the euro), commodities such as gold or silver, stocks, or other cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins include mechanisms that maintain a low deviation from their target price and so are useful to store or exchange value. Their built-in mechanisms remove price volatility.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87934408?v=4)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
