And get to hear from some of the Cardano community who were at Consensus in force to make it such a special event.\n\nWe’ll also share some highlights from our audit and certification workshop in Barcelona at the end of May, where IOG got together with projects building on Cardano to talk about best practices and learn more together about this important topic.\n\nPlus, we’ll have the latest on the progress towards the Vasil upgrade and meet just a few of the people making it all happen - from architects, to test engineers to DApp developers.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this video?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
