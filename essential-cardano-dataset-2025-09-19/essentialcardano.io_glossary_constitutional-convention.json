Following intense debate, the convention resulted in the signing of the first draft of the U.S. Constitution on September 17. The new Constitution replaced the Articles of Confederation and proposed an entirely new form of government.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158074695?v=4)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
