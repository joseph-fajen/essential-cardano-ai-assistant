Because blockchain [transactions](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/transaction-tx) differ from traditional payments (and between systems) by their functionality and volume, [throughput](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/throughput) is a better metric. Whereas Ethereum’s TPS only considers individual transactions, the [EUTXO](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/eutxo) accounting model allows for multiple transactions to be included in a single one. Cardano’s TPS, therefore, cannot accurately be compared to Ethereum’s TPS as 1:1.\n\n## 4 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n![](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/65e2234762bf281a82b748fdc698c416?d=identicon)\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87934408?v=4)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
