It downloads and synchronizes the entire Cardano blockchain, which takes more time and requires significant storage space. Yoroi is a light-node wallet, which means that it gets data from the source with full blockchain access. This eliminates the need to download the full blockchain history, which makes a light wallet faster and easier to use.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this FAQ?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
