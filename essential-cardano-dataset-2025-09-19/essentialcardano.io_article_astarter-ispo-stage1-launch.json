We are pleased to announce that the Astarter ISPO stage1 is officially launched at Epoch 366, Sept 27, 2022.\n\nAs [previously outlined](https://medium.com/astarter/introducing-astarter-ispo-and-merged-staking-protocol-eb500af1f8da), Astarter, as a DeFi infrastructure Hub on Cardano, has a particular interest in ISPO and staking models, not least as projects launching on the Astarter platform may also benefit from our research, development, and participation in this area.\n\nInitial Stake Pool Offering is short for ISPO. “Initial” because it is part of the initial distribution of a new token supply. “Stake Pool” because Cardano stake pools are involved in the process. “Offering” because tokens are a reward offering to ADA HODLers who delegate their ADA to the stake pools.\n\nIn the Astarter two-stage ISPO, HODLers who wish to participate can delegate their ADA to the Public Astarter Stake Pool (pool ticker AA1) or Astarter Merge Stake Pools to get AA tokens as a reward with minimal risk. AA token rewards amount depends on the quantity of ADA staked, the ISPO stage, and the epoch duration.\n\nFollowing our [exploration into ISPOs](https://medium.com/astarter/exploring-methods-of-ispo-on-cardano-15d67fcd2706) in a series of discussions on different methods of ISPO, we found a lot of community support for ISPOs as a distribution method and for raising project awareness and liquidity. Aligning with the permissionless and trustless nature of Cardano Ouroboros enables a balanced and transparent model of ISPO through the Merge Staking Protocol which includes community SPOs.\n\n**Astarter Public Stake Pool- Stage 1**\n\nThe first stage of Astarter ISPO is a method designed to enable ADA delegators to be rewarded in AA and involves Astarter Public Stake Pool set with a 99% margin.\n\n*This project-specific stake pool is configured to a 99% margin, meaning 99% of the ADA rewards per epoch minus pool operating costs are pool fees that go towards funding Astarter project liquidity provision in the form of ADA.*\n\nParticipants of the initial offering can delegate any amount of ADA (minimum 10 ADA) to this [project-specific staking pool](https://cexplorer.io/pool/pool1drkls8s0zzjydyv3qpjsdj58w3sw02w9wg0pckrsnuazyef2hca) for any chosen duration of the offering. Also, they can un-stake their ADA at any time. AA token rewards are calculated per epoch (5 days).‌\n\nStage 1 of the Astarter Initial Stake Offering (ISPO) starts from **Sept 27, 2022 (Epoch 366) to Feb 24, 2023 (Epoch 396) for a maximum of 30 Epochs.**\n\nDuring the five months (30 epochs) maximum ISPO stage 1 period, Astarter will distribute up to **500,000AA in rewards** to ADA delegators. Delegators will receive an estimated 0.5AA base reward per 1000ADA delegated, with reward calculation taking place per epoch.\n\nAllocation for the first stage of the proposed ISPO would come from ecosystem allocation, as the ISPO is not a token sale per se, and the ADA generated would essentially feedback into the ecosystem through liquidity provision.\n\n## **Stage 1 Astarter ISPO Reward Schema**\n\nBonus for early delegators who were delegating ADA from epoch 366 and by 368 for their faithful support towards the Astarter ISPO protocol. There is a three epoch window for users’ ADA delegation to qualify for the early participation bonus. These users will receive an estimated 0.55AA per 1000ADA, with the reward calculation taking place per epoch from epoch 366.\n\n**Pre-ISPO: 1000 ADA/EPOCH= 0.55 AA**\n\n**Base Reward:** **1000 ADA/EPOCH= 0.5 AA**\n\nUsers delegate for:\n\n26+ EPOCHs: Full Moon (base reward+20%)\n\n16–25 EPOCHs: Waxing Gibbous (base reward+10%)\n\n6–15 EPOCHs: First Quarter (base reward+5%）\n\n1–5 EPOCHs: Waxing Crescent (base reward）\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe rationale for stage one is that the distribution method encourages ADA staking to an Astarter project-specific pool while generating ADA liquidity provision for the project.\n\nAA tokens are rewarded based on the quantity of ADA staked, the starting epoch, and the duration. The sooner and longer you delegate, the more AA rewards. The ISPO model, therefore, is closer to a fair launch than any other option, and we think this is particularly exciting as it is native to the core functionality of Cardano.\n\nThe Astarter ISPO model provides consistent and flexible rewards for delegators. Many Astartees anticipate our ISPO launch. The time for onboarding is now as we begin this exciting adventure. It is without a doubt that Astarter rewards more to those delegators who dedicate more time to us. We hope we can hear more voices from our communities.\n\nThank you for reading and please stay tuned to Astarter social channels for more updates and announcements of events and activities taking place.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ALm5wu24qKcfpZiAy-Z0IXdBEJR7miQ2PocuzU63MNOE=s96-c)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this article?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
