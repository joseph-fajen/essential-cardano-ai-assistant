Fresh from CNFTCon, we’ll have Josh Miller on the show to tell us more about C-World. You’ll also hear more about Lace, IOGs new web 3 wallet platform, now in community beta. And we’ll have Santiago from Demeter.run on the show, an exciting new tool for developers building on Cardano.\n\nNigel and Kevin also join us for a quick look at what’s happening on the Cardano development side, and an update on parameters. And last but not least, special guest Hosky joins us for an exclusive bow-wow. So stick around to the end!\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this video?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
