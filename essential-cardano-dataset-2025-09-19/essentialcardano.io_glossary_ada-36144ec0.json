Delegating ada allows the user to receive rewards for doing so. All rewards are distributed in ada every 5 days, i.e. every [epoch](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/epoch).\n\nAda has six decimal places and these fractions of ada are called [lovelaces](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/lovelace). They can be thought of as cents to a dollar.\n\n## 4 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://s.gravatar.com/avatar/86408a48026d8a4fae867056c440712a?s=480&r=pg&d=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.auth0.com%2Favatars%2Fbe.png)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
