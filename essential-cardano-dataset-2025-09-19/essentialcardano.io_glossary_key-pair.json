These keys are used to process and approve transactions within the blockchain.The public key is the address used as a sending or receiving address in a transaction. The private key is the secret that controls access to assets.\n\nAnyone can send assets to a public key address\n\nIt is quick and easy to calculate a public key from a private key, but the reverse is infeasible with current technology\n\nNo one can withdraw assets from an address unless the transaction is signed with the correct private key.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
