Your engagement enables the kind of focused, high-impact engineering that helps move the ecosystem forward.\n\nWe've been tackling tough engineering challenges since 2013. We are passionate contributors to the Cardano ecosystem, where we've led work on everything from security audits and protocol design to its core consensus and ledger systems.\n\nAs part of Modus Create—a global consultancy partnered with brands like Atlassian, AWS, and GitHub—we merge high-level strategy with hands-on delivery. Everything we do is guided by rigorous engineering, open collaboration, and our mission to help Cardano reach its full potential.\n\nWe recognize that technical proposals—while essential—can sometimes feel distant or opaque. Their significance may not always be immediately clear, even to the most dedicated community members. This post is our way of helping to bridge that gap.\n\nBy unpacking the technical initiatives we’re working on—from settlement acceleration to testing frameworks and smart contract tooling—we aim to make the purpose and impact of our work more accessible. Behind every line of code is a shared commitment: to strengthen Cardano’s foundation, to build with integrity, and to grow the capabilities of the ecosystem for everyone involved.\n\nThank you for continuing to support the builders who believe in Cardano’s long-term vision—and are actively delivering it.\n\n## Peras: Accelerating Settlement Guarantees\n\n[Ouroboros Peras](https://peras.cardano-scaling.org/), currently in its pre-alpha stage, enhances settlement guarantees under optimistic network conditions. Compared to the existing protocol, it reduces settlement times from hours to minutes in scenarios with high honest participation and minimal adversarial interference. For additional context, see [CPS-0017](https://cips.cardano.org/cps/CPS-0017).\n\n### Advancing Toward the Peras Testnet\n\nWe propose three core tasks necessary to deploy and experiment with a functional Peras testnet:\n\n**Pre-Alpha Peras Parameterization Dashboard**  \nPeras introduces nuanced trade-offs, such as:\n\nRound length vs. network traffic\n\nBlock selection offset vs. resistance to weak adversaries\n\nCooldown periods vs. Praos safety\n\nWe aim to create a user-friendly web-based dashboard that visualizes these parameters, informed by integration with Leios network simulators.\n\n**Implementation for Caught-Up Nodes and Testnet Deployment**  \nWe will implement Peras for nodes that are caught up, enabling a dedicated testnet to evaluate its behavior and guarantees. Cryptography will be stubbed initially to accelerate testing.\n\n**Centralized Vote Diffusion (Temporary)**  \nTo minimize network impact, votes will initially route through a centralized party. While this introduces a temporary point of failure for Peras, it does not compromise Cardano’s broader safety and liveness guarantees. A decentralized diffusion mechanism will follow.\n\n## Canonical Ledger State: Standardizing Cardano’s Ledger\n\n### The Problem\n\nToday, the ledger state in Cardano is defined by internal Haskell code. Its serialization lacks a canonical, stable format. This presents challenges for:\n\nSigning and distributing snapshots\n\nInteroperability across node implementations\n\nBuilding third-party tooling\n\n### The Proposal\n\nWe aim to define a canonical ledger state format that is:\n\nStable and versioned\n\nDocumented and tooling-friendly\n\nUsable across all node implementations.\n\nThis will simplify development, enable signed snapshots (e.g., via [Mithril](https://docs.cardano.org/developer-resources/scalability-solutions/mithril)), and facilitate robust integration and conformance testing.\n\n## Black Box Ledger Conformance Testing: Assuring Implementation Integrity\n\n### The Problem\n\nFormal specifications in [Agda](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/what-is-agda.html) offer the gold standard for correctness, but are too complex for widespread testing. Other ecosystems (like Ethereum) use simpler test suites that provide sufficient assurance.\n\n### The Proposal\n\nWe propose a black-box conformance testing framework that:\n\nUses the canonical ledger state format\n\nAllows new implementations to run transitions and verify results\n\nOffers tools to generate test cases from existing test infrastructure\n\nThis democratizes access to conformance testing while maintaining alignment with Cardano’s formal specifications.\n\n## Conformance Testing of Consensus: Preventing Accidental Forks\n\n### The Problem\n\nCardano’s consensus assumptions are currently backed by the fact that nodes run identical code. With the rise of alternative node implementations, we need alternative methods to ensure consistency between nodes.\n\n### The Proposal\n\nExtract and adapt existing consensus tests to:\n\nValidate new implementations against the consensus protocol\n\nEnsure network consistency and prevent accidental hard forks\n\nThis safeguards the integrity of Cardano as it evolves into a multi-node ecosystem.\n\n## Plutus Script Re-Executor: Monitoring Smart Contract Execution\n\n### The Problem\n\nDApp developers lack simple tools to analyze on-chain Plutus executions without maintaining a full ledger copy. Access to historical (spent) UTxOs is limited to ~12 hours.\n\n### The Proposal\n\nDeliver a lightweight monitoring tool that:\n\nSynchronizes with the node to re-execute past Plutus scripts\n\nEnables enriched analysis via tracing\n\nMinimizes infrastructure burden\n\nThis tool enhances developer insight into intelligent contract behavior while reducing operational overhead.\n\n## Genesis Sync Accelerator: Boosting Historical Sync Speeds\n\n### The Problem\n\n[Ouroboros Genesis](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-genesis-composable-proof-of-stake-blockchains-with-dynamic-availability/) allows trustless historical sync via multiple stake pool relays. However, syncing from remote locations or at scale burdens relays and reduces performance.\n\n### The Proposal\n\nCreate a tool that:\n\nDownloads blocks and headers from CDNs\n\nMaintains Genesis trust assumptions\n\nFalls back to P2P if CDN serves invalid data\n\nThis approach reduces relay load and accelerates sync for nodes worldwide.\n\n## Canonical Block and Transaction Diffusion Codecs: Simplifying Node Interoperability\n\n### The Problem\n\nEpoch Boundary Blocks (EBBs) and ledger era tags leak implementation details into the network layer. These have confused developers and hinder interoperability.\n\n### The Proposal\n\nRemove EBBs from the historical chain\n\nReplace ledger era tags with clear protocol versioning in CBOR codecs\n\nThis simplification makes node implementation and interop easier and more predictable.\n\n## Hoarding Node: Capturing Orphaned and Invalid Data\n\n### The Problem\n\nCurrently, Cardano discards invalid or orphaned blocks and transactions. This limits:\n\nDebugging\n\nForensic analysis\n\nMonitoring adversarial behavior\n\n### The Proposal\n\nBuild a “hoarding node” that:\n\nActs as a standard relay node\n\nStores all observed blocks and transactions\n\nExposes data via APIs for analysis\n\nImplements heuristics to avoid storage bloat\n\nThis tool enhances transparency, robustness, and network monitoring capabilities.\n\n## Block Cost Investigation: Revisiting Protocol Parameters\n\n### The Problem\n\nParameters such as Δ (max delay for honest block propagation) were set years ago based on Byron/Shelley era assumptions. With complex features like Plutus, actual block validation costs may now exceed these assumptions, introducing risk.\n\n### The Proposal\n\nInvestigate worst-case block costs to:\n\nValidate or revise current assumptions\n\nBuild benchmarks to catch future regression\n\nThis de-risks protocol behavior and supports safer parameter tuning.\n\n## Cardano-Node-Emulator: Maintenance and Modernization\n\n### The Problem\n\nThe Cardano-Node-Emulator (CNE) simulates Cardano node behavior and is vital for testing Plutus scripts. However, it has fallen out of sync with recent updates and lacks active maintenance.\n\n### The Proposal\n\nModus proposes to:\n\nModernize CNE to align with the latest Cardano APIs\n\nContinuously maintain it to support competent contract developers\n\nThis ensures the testing infrastructure remains robust and accessible.\n\n## History Expiry: Trimming the Blockchain Tail\n\n### The Problem\n\nCardano’s seamless upgrade model comes with a cost: a full 7-year history must be stored and processed by every node, increasing:\n\nSync time\n\nDisk usage\n\nNetwork strain\n\n### The Proposal\n\nEnable history expiry using tools like Mithril to:\n\nPrune history past a checkpoint\n\nReduce node hardware requirements\n\nEliminate technical barriers for new implementations\n\nThis makes Cardano more scalable and developer-friendly.\n\n## Why This Work Matters\n\nThese engineering initiatives form some of the foundational infrastructure upon which Cardano's future scalability, security, and developer experience will be built. From deploying and experimenting with a functional Peras testnet to enabling trustless historical sync and creating robust testing frameworks, each proposal addresses fundamental priorities that could facilitate the ecosystem's growth.\n\nThis is the essential work of building digital infrastructure: strengthening the underlying systems, creating developer tools, and establishing the open-source frameworks that enable future innovation.\n\nAs Cardano evolves into a multi-implementation ecosystem, Tweag's contributions become increasingly significant. Our specialized knowledge in consensus protocols, ledger engineering, and distributed systems positions us to tackle complex, interconnected challenges - work that will ultimately help to determine how successfully Cardano scales to serve developers and users worldwide.\n\n[Learn more about our open-source mindset](https://www.tweag.io/opensource) and check out some of our projects.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/02790690-74e3-4ecf-a3a6-49c528708ba9/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this article?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
