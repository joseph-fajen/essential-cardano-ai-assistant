This year, the blockchain’s main focus is to develop and implement scaling solutions methodically.\n\nLayer 2 solutions create additional improvements to the layer 1 protocol, helping a blockchain scale and providing efficient and seamless transaction experiences to its users.\n\nThat’s where layer 2 scaling solutions come in. The Orbis protocol, which I previously discussed in [April’s 360](https://youtu.be/b4x5OIy4shU?t=2843), is one such example.\n\nDuring the show, I gave a detailed explanation of what Orbis would do for Cardano. In this post, you can learn more about Orbis, how it will help the blockchain scale, and why Cardano’s EUTXO model lends itself more to building effective layer 2 solutions compared to other accounting models.\n\n## What are Orbis zk-rollups?\n\nTo understand why the [EUTXO model](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/eutxo) works well for scaling solutions, let’s first look at what these solutions are.\n\nSimply put, [the Orbis protocol](https://blog.orbisprotocol.com/p/enter-orbis?showWelcome=true&s=r) will be Cardano’s first layer 2 zero-knowledge (zk) proof solution that is infinitely scalable. With zk-rollups such as Orbis, a ZK proof enables batching thousands of transactions into a single proof and verification of their validity through a single transaction on the Cardano blockchain.\n\nOrbis is a general-purpose zk-rollup compatible with any DApp that runs on Cardano. The layer 2 solution aims to support [DeFi](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/decentralized-finance-defi) applications by offering enhanced transaction throughput and scalability required for Cardano to truly become a global financial system.\n\nScaling is possible through the following steps:\n\nMultiple [transactions](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/transaction-tx) take place off-chain on [layer 2](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/layer-2).\n\nThey are then bundled into one zero-knowledge proof (zk-rollup).\n\nAnd finally, the zk proof is submitted on-chain to Cardano’s [layer 1](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/layer-1) for verification.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/lbR4eprrCNMPbYjzuWsh2QHQhsuckrWaLrlCvHCokMFBMG8qvV9JvPdmDjcFEIKg0WjeXbCxj_5e8425C6TypBOjCByeb0Rs0O9P7HaCfyjmRdl3oLNBi3POo9rupHW85VMUsce6SEYyDh8pCw)\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/lbR4eprrCNMPbYjzuWsh2QHQhsuckrWaLrlCvHCokMFBMG8qvV9JvPdmDjcFEIKg0WjeXbCxj_5e8425C6TypBOjCByeb0Rs0O9P7HaCfyjmRdl3oLNBi3POo9rupHW85VMUsce6SEYyDh8pCw)\n\n*Figure 1. The relationship between Orbis and Cardano*\n\nThese zk-rollups guarantee, with complete mathematical certainty, that each of the multiple transactions has occurred on the Orbis protocol. And they do so without revealing all the details of said transactions.\n\n### How Orbis' zk-rollups work\n\nOrbis will essentially consist of two main parts:\n\nAn off-chain *Prover* node that processes and proves that transactions are taking place, allowing its users to interact with Orbis and post transactions.\n\nAn on-chain *Verifier* contract that settles transactions happening on-rollup onto the layer 1, accepting asset inputs to be used on the rollup and verifying the Prover’s transactions.\n\nThe ability to effectively compress transactions together on the layer 2 ensures a *much higher throughput* at a *faster speed* and *lower fees*.\n\nZK-Rollups usually operate on an account-based model like Ethereum’s, however, according to Ryan, Cardano’s EUTXO model is better suited for zk-rollups.\n\nHere’s how.\n\n## The benefit of building zk-rollups on a EUTXO accounting model\n\nThe main difference between [the EUTXO and account-based models](https://medium.com/coinmonks/a-simple-explanation-of-cardanos-eutxo-approach-vs-ethereum-s-on-smart-contracts-328a1ce485ff) that gives Cardano the edge comes down to how the two [handle state](https://blog.blockmagnates.com/accounting-models-in-blockchain-utxo-eutxo-and-account-models-3ebbc1493f35).\n\nWhereas Ethereum’s model considers a whole set of data through a [global state](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/global-state), Cardano’s model considers a [local state](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/local-state), only analyzing a relevant transaction’s [UTxOs](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/utxo). This makes it easier to parallelize transactions and bundle them together into a single proof that can then be submitted on-chain.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/M1P3ubGKxRa9kpSThn_L_6uR-fvGjfwmdr8uhy3YAL8Vc_X7VGetCrQyy5WgEHYCaaOkXoY2i8a4WQkLszOF-n5rnazBEYpD7SfiGJ-BLWu7caNpTa2IgrWlFH1FhxxBdlv_1nb9J8UskTqQ5Q)\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/M1P3ubGKxRa9kpSThn_L_6uR-fvGjfwmdr8uhy3YAL8Vc_X7VGetCrQyy5WgEHYCaaOkXoY2i8a4WQkLszOF-n5rnazBEYpD7SfiGJ-BLWu7caNpTa2IgrWlFH1FhxxBdlv_1nb9J8UskTqQ5Q)\n\n*Figure 2. Cardano’s EUTXO model v Ethereum’s Account-based model*\n\n[Parallelism](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/parallelism), one of Cardano’s key features, is basically a system’s ability to create multiple transactions at the same time without any interference.\n\nOn Cardano, parallelism goes hand in hand with [concurrency](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/concurrency), another key advantage of the EUTXO model. As parallelism aligns the transactions, [concurrency processes them simultaneously](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/09/10/concurrency-and-all-that-cardano-smart-contracts-and-the-eutxo-model/). Thus, the maximum achievable parallelism increases as the level of concurrency increases. Through this process, performance and throughput improve.\n\nParallelism and concurrency, therefore, **allow Orbis to leverage the EUTXO model** and scale throughput infinitely in the long run, while reducing the amount of computational data required to process transactions.\n\n## Cardano’s scaling journey continues\n\nAs you can see with Orbis’ zk-rollups approach, Cardano’s architecture is aptly constructed to eventually become the blockchain that provides financial services to the entire globe.\n\nHowever, Orbis isn’t the only way that Cardano is [scaling in 2022](https://www.essentialcardano.io/article/how-were-scaling-cardano-in-2022) and beyond. Learn about these [scalability solutions that are building on Cardano right now](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/04/28/interoperability-is-key-to-blockchain-growth/).\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjzxvJESkfaz21Su63oRJJ4m1vmYAhKsXzhLJJL_A=s96-c)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this article?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
