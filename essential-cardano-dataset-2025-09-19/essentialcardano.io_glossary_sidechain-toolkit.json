The sidechain is connected to the Cardano main chain through a [bridge](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/blockchain-bridge) that allows asset transfer between chains. The finality of blocks is determined through a consensus mechanism that relies on the security of the main chain.\n\nThe [toolkit consists of](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-sidechains/sidechain-toolkit/introduction) Cardano Plutus scripts, a chain follower, and the sidechain module.\n\nThe IOG team has used the toolkit to create a proof of concept [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Cardano sidechain](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-sidechains/example-evm-sidechain/network-details) for developers to test and experiment with.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
