Unlike symmetric cryptography, where the same key is used for both operations, asymmetric cryptography employs two distinct keys: a public key and a private key.\n\nThe public key is openly shared or published, while the private key is kept secret and known only to the owner. The keys are mathematically linked in such a way that data encrypted with one key can only be decrypted with the corresponding key from the pair.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/82d304e7-b626-4573-ae34-86e8decf9e4a/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
