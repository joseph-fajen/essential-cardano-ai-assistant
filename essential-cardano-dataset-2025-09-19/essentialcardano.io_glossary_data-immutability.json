This permanence is achieved through [cryptographic](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/cryptography) hashing and [consensus](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/consensus) mechanisms, ensuring that transactions and information recorded on the blockchain cannot be tampered with or modified retroactively.\n\nImmutable data provides assurance of the integrity and authenticity of transactions, fostering trust and transparency within the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/82d304e7-b626-4573-ae34-86e8decf9e4a/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
