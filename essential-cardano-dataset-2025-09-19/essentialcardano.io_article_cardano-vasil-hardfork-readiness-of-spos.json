Actually 38% blocks (% of all minted blocks in past 2 days) signalling Vasil support (cardano-node version 1.35.3), which is great - this representing almost half of all staked coins.\n\n## The biggest pools - support signalling\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/b244c838-e0e7-4245-8442-a1d8308417e7/-/preview/-/format/auto/-/quality/smart/)\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/b244c838-e0e7-4245-8442-a1d8308417e7/-/preview/-/format/auto/-/quality/smart/)\n\nGreen - latest 1.35.3  \nOrange - 1.35.x (deprecated version)  \nRed - older 1.34.x\n\nVisualised pools with stake more than 2M (order by stake desc)\n\n## Progress in time\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/fb1c2344-54d4-4c89-b2ce-ee95be2db8fe/-/preview/-/format/auto/-/quality/smart/)\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/fb1c2344-54d4-4c89-b2ce-ee95be2db8fe/-/preview/-/format/auto/-/quality/smart/)\n\n## Wen hardfork?\n\nSeveral things need to work together - readiness of exchanges, compatible mostly used DAPPs and upgraded pools (75%), then the trigger will be pulled.\n\nThe page dedicated to network versions is available as live there: <https://cexplorer.io/versions>\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/b2d8ccbe-5460-4c02-bb23-7a2425b9affb/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this article?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
