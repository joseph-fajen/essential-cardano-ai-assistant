This means that this system can recognize and decode other data manipulation rule sets, allowing it to be used to solve any computational problem.\n\nIn terms of programming languages, such a language has to have the following properties:\n\nTuring completeness is used to express the power of a programming language. The programming languages in use today are, in most cases, Turing-complete.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/badc11d4cb406de53b5b12b648bb8177?d=identicon)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
