The Cardano stake pool ecosystem is coming alive, with a host of great stake pools to choose from.\n\nSo where to delegate - and what should you base your choice on?\n\nYou should always do your own research so you can make an informed choice and this isn’t financial advice. But this video might help make your options a little clearer.\n\nIn this video, we start by looking at how the rewards mechanism works on Cardano, and then go on to talk about how you can delegate your ADA in the interests of the network and your own.\n\nIt’s early days and as much as the core protocols and parameters will take us to where we need to be, your choice will determine how fast and how smoothly we get to where we all want to be.\n\nRead more about parameters and decentralization in our recent blog post by Tim Harrison: <https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/11...>\n\nWe also recommend reading \"The general perspective on staking in Cardano\" by Prof Aggelos Kiayias: <https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/11...>\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87934408?v=4)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this video?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
