User can continue to use the same external address to receive ADA for an extended period. However, for privacy reasons, it's a good practice to rotate or generate new addresses periodically.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/82d304e7-b626-4573-ae34-86e8decf9e4a/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
