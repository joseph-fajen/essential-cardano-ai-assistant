[Genesis](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-genesis-composable-proof-of-stake-blockchains-with-dynamic-availability/) adds a novel chain selection rule that enables new or offline parties to safely rejoin the blockchain without a need to do so from the genesis block. This provides the same security guarantees and simplifies the bootstrapping procedure for [nodes](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/node) that were offline for a long period of time.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
