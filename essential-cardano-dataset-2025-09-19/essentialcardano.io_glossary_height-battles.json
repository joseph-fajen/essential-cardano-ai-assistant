The reason for this is that the SPOs do not propagate the block within the appropriate timeframe.\n\nTo completely avoid blocks from getting orphaned in height battles, it is crucial for the block to be disseminated across the entire network within one second (1s).\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/82d304e7-b626-4573-ae34-86e8decf9e4a/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
