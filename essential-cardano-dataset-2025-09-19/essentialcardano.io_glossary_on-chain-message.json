Metadata can be attached to regular ADA transactions or other transactions on the Cardano blockchain. These metadata transactions can contain various types of information, including text, JSON data, or links to external content.\n\nOn-chain messages are useful for Non-Fungible Tokens. Creators can use them to store metadata about NFTs, such as the title, description, and provenance of the digital asset.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/82d304e7-b626-4573-ae34-86e8decf9e4a/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
