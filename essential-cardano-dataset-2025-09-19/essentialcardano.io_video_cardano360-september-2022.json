And in the spirit of highlighting the technical vision and capabilities of Cardano, we feature segments featuring our research and education teams, including a recap of our $4.5M collaboration with Stanford University for a new research hub and how to get involved in our Haskell Bootcamp.\n\nWe’re also joined by David Taylor from the Cardano Foundation to share more about the Cardano Summit and Ben O’Hanlon, IOG’s Head of Community, sits down with Marco and Peyton to talk about CNFTcon and RareBloom.\n\nWant to stay up to date on the latest news, [follow IOG on Twitter](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK) & we’ll keep you posted on all the latest happenings, so you can be in the know, too!\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this video?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
