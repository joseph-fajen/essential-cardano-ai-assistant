In [DEX](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/dex)s, an order book method is used to allow users to transfer assets in a decentralized manner. It a list of open buy and sell offers made by users for a specific number of assets. Every buy order needs to be matched with a sell order.\n\nFor example, a user makes an offer to sell A amount of X assets for B amount of Y assets, which is posted to the order book. When another user who wants to swap B amount of Y assets for A amount of X assets comes along, they fulfill that order and the assets are swapped between the users.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://s.gravatar.com/avatar/86408a48026d8a4fae867056c440712a?s=480&r=pg&d=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.auth0.com%2Favatars%2Fbe.png)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
