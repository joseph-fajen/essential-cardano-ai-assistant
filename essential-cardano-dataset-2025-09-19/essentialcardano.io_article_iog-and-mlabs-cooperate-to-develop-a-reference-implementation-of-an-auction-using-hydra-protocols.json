The first outcome of this collaboration is a [paper](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2023/01/20/implementing-auction-projects-using-hydra/) outlining possible approaches to the implementation of digital asset auctions using the Hydra Head protocol with respective advantages and current limitations. This post introduces a brief summary of the topics covered in more detail in the paper.\n\nThis collaboration aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the current implementation of the Hydra Head protocol to develop auction applications. The proposed reference implementation also constructively determines and aligns the Hydra Head protocol design with the concrete use cases in the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n## A word about auctions\n\nDecentralized auctions use smart contracts to execute a deal between buyers and sellers.\n\nThe benefits of blockchain auctions include:\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/ba969ca7-6eba-452f-b7f8-936fef92cc70/)\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/ba969ca7-6eba-452f-b7f8-936fef92cc70/)\n\n## Running auctions on Cardano\n\nThe [Hydra Head protocol](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/) is a layer 2 scalability solution on Cardano. The protocol consists of smart contracts and software that allow any group of participants to establish isomorphic, multi-party state channels ([Hydra heads](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/02/03/implementing-hydra-heads-the-first-step-towards-the-full-hydra-vision/)) with each other.\n\nHydra head channels are beneficial for running auctions on Cardano because layer 2 solutions provide better capabilities in terms of:\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/f6456949-628a-4afd-a35e-a00a7e67c02d/)\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/f6456949-628a-4afd-a35e-a00a7e67c02d/)\n\n## The Hydra head auction design\n\nCardano can run different auction types using the Hydra Head protocol. Auction designs on a single head can cover basic single-head auctions, single-head secret auctions, delegated custodial auctions, voucher auctions, or delegated voucher auctions. Auction designs on networks of Hydra heads can cover such cases as star-shaped auctions or constellation schema auctions (read this [paper](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2023/01/20/implementing-auction-projects-using-hydra/) for auction style explanations).\n\nFor the reference implementation of an auction using the Hydra Head protocol, the teams chose the delegated voucher auction design including core English-style auction features. For a detailed analysis of possible options with their benefits and limitations, see the paper.\n\nThe initial design of the auction aims to provide the following features:\n\nA group of delegates can open a Hydra head capable of hosting an auction for an NFT asset provided by a seller.\n\nThe seller can distribute the right to participate (eg, via participation tokens) in the auction to prospective bidders who have locked their deductible deposits in a smart contract for the auction.\n\nEach bidder can submit a bid to the auction by sending it to one of the delegates, who will then broadcast it to the rest of the delegates.\n\nDelegates can collectively acknowledge bids by multi-signing via the Hydra Head protocol, thus including the bids in the Hydra head ledger state.\n\nWhen the auction deadline elapses, the delegates can deterministically settle the bids within the Hydra head to determine the winning bid.\n\nDelegates can close the Hydra head:\n\nIf the auction is settled, a voucher can be issued to the winning bidder, which allows the winning bidder to redeem the seller’s NFT asset in exchange for the bid amount.\n\nIf the auction is not settled, its bids can be settled on layer 1 to determine the winning bid, and *then* the voucher can be issued to the winning bidder.\n\nLosing bidders can redeem their deductible deposits when the auction’s Hydra head closes and the auction is settled.\n\nThe winning bidder can use the funds in his deductible deposit in his payment to the seller for the NFT asset.\n\nWhen the voucher is issued to the winning bidder, a deadline is set to redeem the seller’s NFT asset. If the winning bidder does not redeem the seller’s NFT asset by the deadline, the seller can claim the winning bidder’s deductible deposit.\n\nThe voucher UTXO can only be spent by the winning bidder to redeem the seller’s NFT, or by the seller to claim the winning bidder’s deductible deposit after the redemption deadline.\n\n## Learn more from the paper\n\nIf you are interested to find out more, read this **‘**[Implementing auction projects using Hydra](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2023/01/20/implementing-auction-projects-using-hydra/)’ paper.\n\nThe paper reflects on:\n\nThe current needs of projects running digital asset auctions (eg, NFT marketplaces) in the Cardano ecosystem and the challenges they face on the Cardano layer 1 chain.\n\nThe analysis of challenges and requirements suggests possible auction designs to use Hydra for running digital asset auctions and their respective implications for liveness, decentralization, security, and efficiency.\n\nThe proposed Hydra head auction design implementation based on current capabilities.\n\nSuggested improvements to the current Hydra Head protocol along with proposed extensions to the Hydra family of protocols to benefit running digital asset auctions.\n\nTo get involved join [this Discord channel](https://discord.gg/Qq5vNTg9PT) or take part in [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/discussions).\n\n## 4 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiVGcDxbES9QM47iW6Xio34dN8ZMVep9dsPGh9v=s96-c)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this article?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
