The process involves:\n\nGo to <https://meshjs.dev/apis/transaction/minting>\n\nIn the \"Minting Assets\" section, on the right side, you'll see a panel named \"Mint assets and send to recipients\". Just go there.\n\nFill in the fields \"Address\", \"Asset name\", \"Asset label\" (what is \"fungible\"), and \"Quantity\".\n\nConnect your preprod Wallet (\"preprod?\")\n\nClick on \"Run code snippet\"\n\nAnd voila! Tokens in your wallet!\n\nQuestion: did you feel the need to be a developer to start doing things in Cardano? Neither did we. Come and learn a little bit more.\n\nLive Coding session: Weds and Thrus 14:30 UTC.
