Cardano is known as the third-generation blockchain because it uses greener proof-of-stake technology and aims to resolve other issues with the previous generations. In particular, Cardano aims to ensure higher performance, resolve scalability and interoperability issues, and ensure that the blockchain is self-sustainable.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this FAQ?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
