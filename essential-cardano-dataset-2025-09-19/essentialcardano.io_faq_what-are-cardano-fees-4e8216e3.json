Fees contribute to the network's financial health and development, and prevent economic attacks. [Cardano’s deterministic nature](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/09/06/no-surprises-transaction-validation-on-cardano/) ensures that fees are stable, predictable, and low in comparison to such proof-of-work blockchains like Ethereum, for example.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this FAQ?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
