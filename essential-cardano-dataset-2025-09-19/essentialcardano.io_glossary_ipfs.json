It is a decentralized and distributed peer-to-peer file storage system that aims to provide a more efficient and resilient way to store and access files on the internet.\n\nIn IPFS, files are broken up into smaller pieces, which are distributed across the network and stored on multiple nodes. When a user requests a file, their computer retrieves the pieces from various nodes and reassembles them into the original file. This distributed approach to file storage provides several benefits, including increased availability, faster file transfers, and improved resistance to censorship and data loss.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/82d304e7-b626-4573-ae34-86e8decf9e4a/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
