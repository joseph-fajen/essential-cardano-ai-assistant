[‘Light’ wallets](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/light-wallet) for Cardano such as [Yoroi](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/yoroi) are designed for fast, easy access via browser or on a mobile phone; full node wallets such as [Daedalus](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/daedalus) are designed for desktops. While they require a high-spec machine and regular syncing, they are the most secure (non-hardware) wallet and help maintain the network by downloading a full copy of the blockchain each time they are used.\n\n## 3 contributors\n\n![](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/65e2234762bf281a82b748fdc698c416?d=identicon)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87934408?v=4)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
