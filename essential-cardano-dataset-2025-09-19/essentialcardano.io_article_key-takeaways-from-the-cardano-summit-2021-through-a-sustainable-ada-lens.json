My biggest takeaway from the event was sharing and connecting with community members in person. It was mesmerizing connecting with members whom I've been speaking with online over the past year. Like James from Gimbalabs!”***\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e48283_a85ad13ae3b84906aa2b5e7def45f6ee~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_720,h_731,al_c,q_90/e48283_a85ad13ae3b84906aa2b5e7def45f6ee~mv2.webp)\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e48283_a85ad13ae3b84906aa2b5e7def45f6ee~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_720,h_731,al_c,q_90/e48283_a85ad13ae3b84906aa2b5e7def45f6ee~mv2.webp)\n\n***“While speaking and meeting Charles I shared a couple of words about Sustainable ADA. He suggested using the Catalyst Idea Scale platform to help get our ideas rolling.***\n\n***I was able to share our past experiences with Charles and how Sustainable ADA has participated in Catalyst Funds 4, 5, & 6.***\n\n***To solidify this amazing moment he gave me a huge fist bump.”***![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e48283_3f76ea2bcf8e4acf9c4d81774985320f~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1480,h_1012,al_c,q_90/e48283_3f76ea2bcf8e4acf9c4d81774985320f~mv2.webp)\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e48283_3f76ea2bcf8e4acf9c4d81774985320f~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1480,h_1012,al_c,q_90/e48283_3f76ea2bcf8e4acf9c4d81774985320f~mv2.webp)\n\n**Sustainable ADA is the only project connecting the dots in the Cardano ecosystem and beyond by bringing sustainable news media and insights into projects that are having and seeking to build a better world for all.**\n\n**Learn more:**\n\nWebsite: <https://www.sustainableada.com>\n\nTwitter: <https://twitter.com/SustainableADA>\n\nLinkedin: <https://www.linkedin.com/company/sustainableada>\n\nInstagram: <https://www.instagram.com/sustainableada/>\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjqHNUjmroN3l6NGFkh4E3EvJzeB9Y3s07qnrUG=s96-c)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this article?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
