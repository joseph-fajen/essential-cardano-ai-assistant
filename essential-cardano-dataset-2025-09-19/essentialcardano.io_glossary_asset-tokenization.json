On Cardano, the network supports the creation of custom tokens through its [native token](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/native-tokens) standard, allowing users to represent any asset or utility directly on the blockchain.\n\nUse Cases include fractional ownership of real estate, digital representation of art and collectibles, tokenization of financial assets, and intellectual property rights.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/82d304e7-b626-4573-ae34-86e8decf9e4a/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
