For example, one ada is the same as all others and so is fungible. Shares in a company, gold bars, and US dollars, for example, are all fungible. Cryptos are usually fungible, but there are also unique, [non-fungible tokens (NFTs)](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/nft).\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
