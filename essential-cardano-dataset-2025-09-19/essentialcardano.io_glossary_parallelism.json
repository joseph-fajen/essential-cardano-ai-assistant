On Cardano, parallelism goes hand in hand with [concurrency](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/concurrency), another key advantage of the EUTXO model. As parallelism aligns the transactions, [concurrency processes them simultaneously](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/09/10/concurrency-and-all-that-cardano-smart-contracts-and-the-eutxo-model/). Thus, the maximum achievable parallelism increases as the level of concurrency increases. Through this process, performance and throughput improve.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjwsGPem9hyZkV2B5wKOZfeJt4oo87uYgktuPql=s96-c)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
