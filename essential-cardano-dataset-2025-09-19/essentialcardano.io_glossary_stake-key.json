Stake keys give you access to any rewards held in the stake address, as well as the ability to delegate the wallet to a pool to earn staking rewards.\n\nNote that ADA holders can have multiple stake keys and can delegate their ADA to different stake pools simultaneously.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/82d304e7-b626-4573-ae34-86e8decf9e4a/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
