This is made possible due to the unique design of addresses on Cardano.\n\nA Franken address allows users to separate their staking rewards into a separate wallet. Some application developers can leverage delegation rights to receive rewards or help users maintain their staking rights while those funds are locked in the smart contract. Additionally, Franken addresses are also used as a way to maintain privacy for assets held in a wallet.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/82d304e7-b626-4573-ae34-86e8decf9e4a/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
