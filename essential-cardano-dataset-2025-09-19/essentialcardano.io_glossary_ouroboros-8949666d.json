Ouroboros ensures that all participants agree on valid transactions. It is the first consensus protocol proven to be secure through academic peer review. The name comes from an ancient symbol that represents eternity and symbolizes the theoretical eternity of a blockchain. There have been several versions of Ouroboros: [Classic](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/ouroboros-classic) (Byron phase, 2017), [BFT](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/ouroboros-bft) (Byron/Shelley phases, 2020), [Praos](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/ouroboros-praos) (Shelley phase, 2020), [Genesis](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/ouroboros-genesis) (planned for 2023), [Chronos](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/ouroboros-chronos) (in planning), [Crypsinous](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/ouroboros-crypsinous) (no deployment planned for Cardano).\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
