In current Cardano versions, a slot is exactly one second. Slots that are inhabited by [blocks](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/block) are called *active slots*. In early 2022, Cardano parameters set one in 20 slots as active, so the average block time is 20 seconds.\n\n## 3 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87934408?v=4)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
