It consists of a collection of nodes that communicate with each other to maintain the distributed ledger. These nodes validate blocks, add blocks to the chain, and distribute transactions.\n\nThe networking layer is the driving force for delivering information exchange requirements for establishing a better data flow. Cardano nodes maintain connections with peers that have been chosen via a custom peer selection process.\n\nA set of mini-protocols is used to enable communication between different nodes. Each mini-protocol implements a basic information exchange requirement, such as:\n\ninforming peers of the latest block\n\nsharing blocks as needed\n\nsharing new transactions around the Cardano network.\n\nFor connection purposes, mini-protocols are determined by the version of the network protocol. For example, there are two protocol suites: *node-to-node* and *node-to-client*. The node-to-client protocol suite is used by wallets and chain consumers. Protocol suites use different sets of mini-protocols and the version is negotiated when a new connection is established.\n\nFind out more:\n\n[The Cardano network](https://docs.cardano.org/explore-cardano/cardano-network/about-the-cardano-network)\n\n[Networking protocol design](https://docs.cardano.org/explore-cardano/cardano-network/networking-protocol)\n\n[Peer-to-peer (P2P) networking](https://docs.cardano.org/explore-cardano/cardano-network/p2p-networking)\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this FAQ?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
