Cardano uses deterministic pricing, which means you know how much a transaction will cost before you make it. Protocol parameters, rather than network traffic, govern pricing on Cardano, so prices remain stable and low. No fees are charged for failed transactions, which differentiates Cardano from indeterministic chains like Ethereum.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
