It serves as a way to uniquely identify and verify the policy associated with a specific native token or set of native tokens. This fingerprint allows users to validate that the policy for a token adheres to the predefined rules.\n\nPolicy ID is an integral part of Cardano's multi-asset ledger model, which helps govern the issuance and management of tokens.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/82d304e7-b626-4573-ae34-86e8decf9e4a/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
