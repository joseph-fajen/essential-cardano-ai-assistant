It measures the number of hash operations that a network can perform in a second.\n\nIn a PoW, miners use specialized hardware to perform complex mathematical calculations, known as hash functions, to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. The hash rate is a measure of the speed at which this process occurs.\n\nThe hash rate is typically measured in hashes per second (H/s), kilohashes per second (KH/s), megahashes per second (MH/s), gigahashes per second (GH/s), terahashes per second (TH/s), or even petahashes per second (PH/s).\n\nCardano uses a [proof of stake](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-is-proof-of-stake-pos) consensus mechanism so there is no concept of hash rate on Cardano.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/82d304e7-b626-4573-ae34-86e8decf9e4a/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
