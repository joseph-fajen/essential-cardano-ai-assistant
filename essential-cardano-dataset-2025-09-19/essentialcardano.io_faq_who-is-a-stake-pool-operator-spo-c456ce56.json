This usually entails owning or renting a server, holding the key to the pool, and maintaining and monitoring the node. The operator earns rewards for validating transactions on Cardano. These rewards are distributed between the operator and the ada holders who delegated their stake to the pool.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this FAQ?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
