Cardano uses a unique address format that differs from many other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. It consists of two parts: the payment address and the stake address, which involves staking ADA to earn rewards.\n\nThese addresses can start with \"addr\" and are case-insensitive. For example: \"*addr1qytdq4cjldj7lruyq5ppm7wzg6z7tk95j8njqay3g60f8rq7k3cvvlkegt9wv8ar4knyl4vkj63w8e5a8rzm6fqsx6hjk4gzvt3\"*.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/82d304e7-b626-4573-ae34-86e8decf9e4a/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
