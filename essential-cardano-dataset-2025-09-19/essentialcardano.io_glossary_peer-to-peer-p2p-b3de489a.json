Direct communication means the network is faster and more efficient. Also, because no single point of potential failure exists, the [network](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/networking) is more resilient. P2P also simplifies the process of running a relay node (one of the [nodes](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/node) run by [stake pool operators](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/stake-pool-operator), which does not produce [blocks](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/block)) or a block-producing node to validate [transactions](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/transaction-tx) on the network faster.\n\n## 3 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
