At Gimbalabs Open Spaces we experiment not only with code, but also with tools that can contribute to create more focused and creative organizations.\n\nThat's how in yesterday's OS we played a little bit with *Notion*, a true all-in-one tool. Check this out: <https://www.youtube.com/live/m5XieJ8bsm8?si=g1NEH7CUpW9xvv3n&t=1508>\n\nWhat's in store for today's Gimbalabs Open Space, March 28th? We don't really know: üë©‚Äçüî¨more experimentation, ü§ømore playing, but most of all, üèóÔ∏èmore collaboration and meaningful contribution.\n\nüëÖJoin us!
