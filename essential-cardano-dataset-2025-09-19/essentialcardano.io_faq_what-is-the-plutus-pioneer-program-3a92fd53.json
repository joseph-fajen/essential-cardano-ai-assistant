Recruits are given access to courses about the principles of coding in both Haskell and Plutus. The course is highly interactive, with weekly videos, exercises, and Q&A sessions, along with exclusive access to Plutus creators and experts. There is also a dedicated community channel to help pioneers connect with each other.
