Only gets official mainnet releases.\n\nExplorer: <https://cexplorer.io/>\n\n## Preview testnet\n\nUsage: Testing release candidates and mainnet releases. Leads mainnet hard forks by at least 4 weeks.\n\nExplorer: <https://preview.cexplorer.io/>\n\n## Pre-production testnet\n\nUsage: Testing release candidates and mainnet releases. Forks at approximately same time as mainnet (within an epoch of each other).\n\nExplorer: <https://preprod.cexplorer.io/>\n\n## Old testnet (legacy)\n\nNote that the Cardano **testnet** is no longer recommended for new functionality testing. It only supports nodes v.1.35.0, v.1.35.1, and v.1.35.2. The testnet will be fully deprecated after Vasil mainnet release.\n\nExplorer: <https://testnet.cexplorer.io/>\n\nConfiguration files for cardano-node are available in official documentation about enviroments: <https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-world/blob/master/docs/environments.md>\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/b2d8ccbe-5460-4c02-bb23-7a2425b9affb/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this article?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
