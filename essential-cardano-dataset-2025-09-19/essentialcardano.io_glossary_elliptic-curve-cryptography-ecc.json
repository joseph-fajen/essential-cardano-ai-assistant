ECC provides the same level of security as other mechanisms while using shorter keys and signatures. Examples of elliptic curves include Standards for Efficient Cryptography ([SECP](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/secp)**)** signatures such as Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and Schnorr.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
