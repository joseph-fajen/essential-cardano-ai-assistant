Cardano's EUTXO combines and matures Bitcoin's security and Ethereum's programmability. This model is vastly superior to the account-based model used by other blockchains because it ensures:\n\n**Enhanced security**: every transaction uses a different address, which makes it impossible to track the address or find out the user’s overall balance.\n\n**Scalability**: UTXO ledgers allow for transaction parallelization, which reduces congestion.\n\n**Interoperability**: due to the implementation of off-chain and sidechain protocols, it is easier to establish interoperability between different blockchains.\n\n**Determinism**: on the UTXO ledger, a user can predict the cost and validity of a transaction before it is processed on the chain. Transaction costs are also much lower in the UTXO model as there are no ‘gas’ fees.\n\n## 3 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87934408?v=4)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this FAQ?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
