Smart contract programming is also used to ensure that the stablecoin will work effectively for decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions.\n\nDjed operates by maintaining a reserve of base coins, while minting and burning various other stable assets and reserve coins. It is designed to be used for paying transaction fees on the Cardano network. One benefit of this is to make transaction costs more predictable, so avoiding volatile and exorbitant gas fees for users.\n\nThe COTI development team believes that stablecoins are a 'killer app' that will be adopted by a large number of crypto users for settling payments and covering fees. The company was the first recipient of [equity investment from the cFund](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/07/28/a-closer-look-at-the-cfund/) for Cardano developments.\n\nShahaf Bar-Geffen, chief executive of [COTI Group](https://coti.io/), said: 'The stablecoin ecosystem has matured tremendously over the past few years. Blockchain participants are using stablecoins to engage in everyday transactions because they allow monetary value to be exchanged in a seamless manner, regardless of the sender and recipient’s location.\n\n'I believe that adding the Djed stablecoin to the Cardano blockchain will significantly improve how transactions are settled on the platform.'\n\nIO Global chief executive Charles Hoskinson said: 'The Djed stablecoin could be a game-changer in the crypto space, appealing to an entirely new audience at a time when the industry is already experiencing astronomical growth. Djed shares our commitment to formal verification, proving a robust method of combating price volatility of crypto markets.\n\n'COTI has been a long-time partner of the Cardano ecosystem. It’s great to have them on board with this new venture.'\n\nCheck out the [Djed website](https://djed.xyz/).\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this article?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
