Haskell developer, this amount”, and it’s just so spammy, I don’t know them, I don’t know why I would want to talk with them.*\n\n*So there’s not a good presentation, there’s not a good place for people present themselves, and the places people are using don’t seem to be helping very much.”*\n\n[Blink Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/blink-labs-io/) is a company that is building in Cardano for the future, using and building technologies that can scale, with a team that comes from companies like *Box, Apple, Yahoo, Microsoft, and Google*. When Cardano companies of this caliber can’t meet their basic technical talent needs natively at Cardano, they have to go outside to get it: ***Houston, we have a problem.***\n\nHowever: ***Houston,*** [Andamio platform](https://www.andamio.io/) ***is working on a solution.***\n\nIn the informal, non-standard, inefficiency-ridden scenario for both parties described by *Christina*, the solution [Andamio](https://www.andamio.io/) brings to the table can be defined within the context of the following pattern: collect *skills evidence*, analyze that evidence, establish whether the *foundational skills* are in place, in which case the next step is to develop a *training process from those fundamentals*, collect *skills evidence* again, and finally, create an *on-chain* record of requirements satisfaction.\n\nWhat foundational skills should be assessed at the beginning of the cycle? While the list can be as long as organizations see fit, three aspects stand out as those upon which more specialized skills can be built in the framework of *organization-employee collaboration*:\n\nKnowledge of the fundamentals of a specific technology or set of technologies.\n\nAbility to learn\n\nAbility to teamwork\n\n[Andamio platform](https://x.com/AndamioPlatform) is a *learn-to-work* platform for learning and contribution. Andamio’s *contribution platform* provides the fundamental *skills assessment framework* that organizations require, and when there is talent to start with, Andamio’s *learning platform* provides the *Project-Based Learning environment* that injects the skills required by the organization.\n\nThanks to *Christina* for offering such valuable insights, and thanks to [Anastasia](https://x.com/AnaBondItka1) for such a fantastic interview: <https://youtu.be/xMm13xE57jI?si=BNdNPYhe34hkk0jd>\n\n[Andamio platform](https://www.andamio.io/)’s commitment to advancing Cardano’s technical infrastructure based on building replicable systems is evident in its ambitious development initiatives.
