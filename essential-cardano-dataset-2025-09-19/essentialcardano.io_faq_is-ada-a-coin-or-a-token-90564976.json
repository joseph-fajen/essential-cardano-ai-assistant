Yet there is a difference between the two – a ‘coin’ has its own native blockchain whereas a ‘token’ is created on an existing blockchain.\n\nAda (‘Ticker: ADA’) is the native cryptocurrency on Cardano and is the only currency used on Cardano to pay fees, make deposits and distribute rewards. In this sense, ada is a coin because it is native to Cardano in the same way that bitcoin is a coin on the Bitcoin blockchain and ether is a coin on Ethereum.\n\nCoins represent one type of digital assets. Other types of digital [assets](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/asset) may still represent a footprint of value but may be designed for different purposes. These include tokens, NFTs, stablecoins, and other digital assets which represent value in the real world, such as a property deed, a government or corporate bond, an education certificate, ownership of a basketball boot, information, or a vote in an election. On Cardano, all of these can be represented as a ‘[native token](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/native-tokens)’. This means an NFT or another type of asset can be ‘minted’ (created) directly on the blockchain, without having to use a smart contract. This native capability is not available on other blockchains.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this FAQ?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
