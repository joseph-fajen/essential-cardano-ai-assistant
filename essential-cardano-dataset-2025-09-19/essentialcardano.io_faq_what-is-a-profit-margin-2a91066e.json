A lower profit margin for the operator means they are taking less, which means that delegators can expect to receive more of the rewards for their delegated stake. A private pool is a pool with a profit margin of 100%, meaning that all the rewards will go to the operator and none to the delegators.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this FAQ?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
