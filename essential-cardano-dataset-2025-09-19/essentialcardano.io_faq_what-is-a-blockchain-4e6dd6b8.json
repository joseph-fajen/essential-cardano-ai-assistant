In a blockchain, nodes (people's computers) agree on the validity of any given transaction using what is called a [consensus](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-is-consensus) mechanism. Transactions are grouped together and stored in blocks that are added to the chain in set periods of time called [slots](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-are-blocks-slots-and-epochs).
