The EVM sidechain allows the Solidity developer community [to build DApps](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-sidechains/example-evm-sidechain/deploy-smart-contracts/setup-development) on a lower-fees and environmentally friendly platform that consumes far less energy than proof-of-work blockchains.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
