Joining Tim are regulars John Woods and Kevin Hammond. In this mid-month edition, we’ll have a special chapter diving into Plutus by John Woods. We’ll also have a brief update from just a few of the 850+ projects now building on Cardano.\n\n**NOTE:** Inclusion in this show is for informational and educational purposes only and should not be treated as financial advice or as a direct endorsement of any individual project building on Cardano. Always do your own research.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this video?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
