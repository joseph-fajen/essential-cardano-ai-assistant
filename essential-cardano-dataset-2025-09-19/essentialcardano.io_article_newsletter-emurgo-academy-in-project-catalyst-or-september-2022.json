Undoubtedly, one of the partners that can be assigned to that category is EMURGO Academy, as we were honored as official sponsors of the event.\n\n**![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BtKVOnPMoRnLlLRM1wvIJSQDfLI1Fpq5l7RQkSTynm5k05fsR5AbHxULarxohdrS0bnMwFytDH5he5SgWgq3pr2rjhruhH50U2D_x1oMb26HgT5Dw6p-DZL_hRjjhndayP1K4eiELbxuEwuXmWLInr49Y5fXGhRD_-IQAJ6tA56Ah5ov_l0MBOMXhA)**\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BtKVOnPMoRnLlLRM1wvIJSQDfLI1Fpq5l7RQkSTynm5k05fsR5AbHxULarxohdrS0bnMwFytDH5he5SgWgq3pr2rjhruhH50U2D_x1oMb26HgT5Dw6p-DZL_hRjjhndayP1K4eiELbxuEwuXmWLInr49Y5fXGhRD_-IQAJ6tA56Ah5ov_l0MBOMXhA)\n\n`Main auditorium of the National Technological University (UTN) of Buenos Aires (Argentina).`\n\n`Main auditorium of the National Technological University (UTN) of Buenos Aires (Argentina).`\n\n**![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jyKKIbgSOLMheHGJ72RJewL6tBC_RPpZPU1Rw0JNAq0Sz2GkHpYCx8JG9P8n7yaO6QsWmuOnx9J_5Dzf1E0nO1ggBwGCU_rdd_Ewa-p1Nx_Vb1hFn6SIbpT4_KpJKaK0DcgwxLtu-OatG1hiHKNHvDP2E5ZIZX73c-CyWuG8ueCFfu4y-zngrpKBSw)**\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jyKKIbgSOLMheHGJ72RJewL6tBC_RPpZPU1Rw0JNAq0Sz2GkHpYCx8JG9P8n7yaO6QsWmuOnx9J_5Dzf1E0nO1ggBwGCU_rdd_Ewa-p1Nx_Vb1hFn6SIbpT4_KpJKaK0DcgwxLtu-OatG1hiHKNHvDP2E5ZIZX73c-CyWuG8ueCFfu4y-zngrpKBSw)\n\n`During our presentation`\n\n`During our presentation`\n\n## Our sponsorship consisted of three (3) full scholarships of our [flagship program “Cardano Developer Professional”](https://education.emurgo.io/courses/cardano-developer-professional) for the winning team of the Hackathon. The winning team \"HaskellBois\", integrated by two Latin American students (here [an interview with Ignacio Dopazo](https://youtu.be/CCcf7utpkRY), one of its members, days after the end of the event) won two of these scholarships.  The third one was donated to the organizer of the Hackathon and leader of the [ADA Solar](https://twitter.com/CardanoSolar) team, Jose Iadicicco, as we reasoned that this scholarship can contribute greatly to the development of his challenging project.\n\n## We hope that the spirit of this type of academic events will spread like wildfire throughout all regions of the world whose students feel within themselves the courageous call to create and innovate.  We, [EMURGO Academy](https://education.emurgo.io/), are waiting for you.\n\n## This was [our presentation at the Cardano Hackathon in Argentina](https://youtu.be/Brzm4eSK6yw?t=10855).\n\n**![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Pk5kJOgdI7I8o0LF9jfviVM1EGtQoDadi6ftx_nFt6dnnhMTsGGQ2cYex0bEaw2zIPGzKTaYI_EcpAFJgqcH76B10FfWmScTdnRB4wIA7uWo1E3oUvaKpwNx-il3Rm2dq52iGeFvfJDcAZ-d_xNS7BlvWg-ZhCEMcP8wea88i1_0Gdp6ZeZ0A3o7iQ)**\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Pk5kJOgdI7I8o0LF9jfviVM1EGtQoDadi6ftx_nFt6dnnhMTsGGQ2cYex0bEaw2zIPGzKTaYI_EcpAFJgqcH76B10FfWmScTdnRB4wIA7uWo1E3oUvaKpwNx-il3Rm2dq52iGeFvfJDcAZ-d_xNS7BlvWg-ZhCEMcP8wea88i1_0Gdp6ZeZ0A3o7iQ)\n\n`Team HaskellBois, winners of the Hackathon, and new EMURGO Academy students.`\n\n`Team HaskellBois, winners of the Hackathon, and new EMURGO Academy students.`\n\n**In our “Blockchain Security” series: Best Practices for Cardano dApp hackproofing.**\n\n## Each month we look to have an event on a specific topic that allows our students and the Catalyst community to get first-hand, case-based information delivered directly from Cardano members with an outstanding track record of knowing what they are talking about.  By bringing together speakers with projects and startups from the ecosystem that are recognized in their respective areas of action, this series of talks have proven to be very useful and inspiring for Catalyst members and EMURGO Academy students who are thinking about participating in innovation funds, as well as Academy graduates and active Cardano members whose projects or companies get to connect with the knowledge that, as a result of their experience, the speakers deliver to the attendees.  The live Q&A sessions are the setting that complements the dynamic of absorbing as much knowledge as possible from these thought leaders who have demonstrated their contribution to Cardano as a technology that disrupts the status quo of today's legacy systems.  Attendees come to empathize with the guests to the level of understanding not only the technical details that describe their work, they also come to understand their entrepreneurial struggle and see that the possibilities for creation and innovation are real, the tools to do so exist: seed capital through Catalyst funding, technical guidance through an entire community of creators willing to collaborate with those in difficulty, constant formation of partnerships and collaborations, among other issues.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/w5LRTb1C3WZJ9Zjx_9JmI4cnEC2N9aMWR3JJBU7kZFBbXEP5XFXCNjGkaFzX5FKAB27SW7Wr3Wp09C60jVwP1s5dvW4D7Iw_-w5CxWhlwsmnM8Nr7nKzPICb6B9RKitBgcyPfyxHpkYh-f-qyva9h-AP2FhIAMiV3gc4HoG8F0jmjZPA3VjBkQrTRA)\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/w5LRTb1C3WZJ9Zjx_9JmI4cnEC2N9aMWR3JJBU7kZFBbXEP5XFXCNjGkaFzX5FKAB27SW7Wr3Wp09C60jVwP1s5dvW4D7Iw_-w5CxWhlwsmnM8Nr7nKzPICb6B9RKitBgcyPfyxHpkYh-f-qyva9h-AP2FhIAMiV3gc4HoG8F0jmjZPA3VjBkQrTRA)\n\n`Promotional of our monthly event`\n\n`Promotional of our monthly event`\n\nBy MLabs, Maksymilliam Brodowicz: he developed backend service in Haskell for VoiceLab.ai and was a technical team lead at IOHK where he worked designing, creating, and extending smart contracts on Cardano. He is currently at MLabs where he is the Haskell & Plutus technical lead.\n\nBy Gimbalabs, Roberto C. Morano: besides being co-founder of Gimbalabs and DevOps Advocate of the Cardano Foundation, he is the creator of the Dandelion API.  In the past, he was Lead DevOps Advocate at Emurgo Global managing many OpenSource projects.\n\nBy Vacuumlabs, Philip Disarro: He worked as an Artificial Intelligence Engineer at Blazetech where he developed a state of the art deep learning model designed to identify and extract event precursors from unstructured text data of the NTSB(National Transportation Safety Board) aviation accident reports. Philip has also worked as software & Quality Assurance engineer at SunDensity a company that provides photonic solar conversion products and services where he was developing systems to automate the testing and benchmarking of their products.  Currently at Vacuumlabs where he is tasked with smart contract development and auditing using a variety of specialized Haskell eDSLs like Plutarch, Pluto, and Plutus along with extensive work with Cardano-tx-lib, Plutus Application Backend, and Lucid.\n\n## It is no secret that many proposers whose ideas are funded, reach the implementation stage without resolving important technical aspects of their proposals.  Participation in this type of events (fortunately in the ecosystem we have a wide range of accessible academic events like this one) can offer unexpected solutions or at least the beginning of a clearer path forward.  Speaking specifically about EMURGO Academy's monthly events, one thing we can assure you: our guests do not reserve anything for themselves. A combination of generosity on their part and persistence on ours means that the juice of their knowledge and experience is squeezed out to the last drop (of course, the juice that is possible to pack into 2-hour bottles).\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NWbCP9PakufufJxtl0rfx65TjM-URqH_kwQeZtkJOMe3SGu8cYq_qG8obL3ffMqDECSLh3km8t2dmaIHAZWLPX0ewxgXloMvvz3e471N0_bxdwHhnU_HuKeQ38NiiOXhteWnQ8TvP24k_AbJXq8z-TngbZ4uahiu-ucU4FwvlgTQF5XqIaT16JRImw)\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NWbCP9PakufufJxtl0rfx65TjM-URqH_kwQeZtkJOMe3SGu8cYq_qG8obL3ffMqDECSLh3km8t2dmaIHAZWLPX0ewxgXloMvvz3e471N0_bxdwHhnU_HuKeQ38NiiOXhteWnQ8TvP24k_AbJXq8z-TngbZ4uahiu-ucU4FwvlgTQF5XqIaT16JRImw)\n\n`During the event: Maksimilian, Roberto and Philip answering questions from Bernard Sibarda,`\n\n`During the event: Maksimilian, Roberto and Philip answering questions from Bernard Sibarda,`\n\n`CEO of the project WIMS - educating girls in Africa, attending the event.`\n\n`CEO of the project WIMS - educating girls in Africa, attending the event.`\n\n## Here you can find the [recording of the event with Maksimilian, Roberto and Philip.](https://youtu.be/6Znu1gWlHko)\n\n## *BONUSTRACK:*\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zQU_nFAKIzojK2bImI1va-NlHnidYGwwabWuWlPoptqFLhRKx52erz36IOf5R58M8cJYf3WGAlvnpawVfjF4jofL_ky7-HALbAV2y0L7O71zpOp55rz6I-PtkQgCHk0GblAO7Pr9H35LUrXhpxdWH7g8xHRoxeBm9StOyvU-2DA2Na_2yEgys9DbiQ)\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zQU_nFAKIzojK2bImI1va-NlHnidYGwwabWuWlPoptqFLhRKx52erz36IOf5R58M8cJYf3WGAlvnpawVfjF4jofL_ky7-HALbAV2y0L7O71zpOp55rz6I-PtkQgCHk0GblAO7Pr9H35LUrXhpxdWH7g8xHRoxeBm9StOyvU-2DA2Na_2yEgys9DbiQ)\n\n## Here you can find a recording of a panel discussion we held last month with four outstanding and respected Catalyst entrepreneurs, which we called, [\"What next after getting funded in Project Catalyst Fund9?\"](https://youtu.be/ElSB6rjKZHg)\n\n**Bye bye Fund9, see you the next month Fund10.**\n\n## Last Monday, September 19th at exactly 16:00 UTC the Project Catalyst Fund9 voting period came to an end.  Activities such as publication of results; distribution of rewards to PAs, vPAs and voters; onboarding of new Fund9 funded proposers are still on the to-do list, however, the close of voting marks the end of the competition.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UGnaWvYqybfhP590jokGy29w1pRVGXlSDdQuPs0qwOA8HAjYHbsNRaMuiv-VStzK2TfHhdKg45HxRqKYZL2QpDQMefDBoo8jc7hGvYtnvZEWlEUsNOXSAUmbXAGDJAs6wOTlJLRfJo994Mnuh_H5esWUDV5W03hp6zYbfaHL7nYbF-_u9G2eyVAmUw)\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UGnaWvYqybfhP590jokGy29w1pRVGXlSDdQuPs0qwOA8HAjYHbsNRaMuiv-VStzK2TfHhdKg45HxRqKYZL2QpDQMefDBoo8jc7hGvYtnvZEWlEUsNOXSAUmbXAGDJAs6wOTlJLRfJo994Mnuh_H5esWUDV5W03hp6zYbfaHL7nYbF-_u9G2eyVAmUw)\n\n`Catalyst Voting App`\n\n`Catalyst Voting App`\n\n## As an aspiring proposer, there is nothing else to do but wait for the results.

The medal on the chest.  But it no longer feels the same, or at least not as expected.  More work on top of the work already being done: the plate is completely full.\n\n## The end of one cycle is the beginning of another. In Catalyst, that's a virtue and it's also a curse.  In any case, no one ever said that the job of making the world a better place was a simple one. If it were, anyone would do it.\n\n## **EMURGO Academy at Catalyst Cardano Women.**\n\n## There is no doubt about the wealth of people in the Catalyst ecosystem that one can be fortunate enough to meet each week at the various community events.  One of those events is the Swarm's After the Town Hall (which as the name suggests, takes place right after the weekly Town Hall on Wednesdays) and one of those people is Dzhuliana Nikolova, co-founder and CTO of [OneUpOneDown](https://oneuponedown.org/), highly scalable AI mentor matching platform and framework that connects women from all over the world with their perfect match.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mieXlsTzRLYR6pyqohvasRqkaPuwnO5u2m1C-eqr-8l-Xo4Qpk7d4uFA8Y96GP1XStxDDzkanyc8uPGwQLGK4PRiZAAycDna4mjJlMcHNuYMNb778UKP-VEU1tE--Hn9JmmE29hQWImgvhktGdHVL-_iBtwgnQFdg9s8i_IdrmJU-eHuQIniONpuMQ)\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mieXlsTzRLYR6pyqohvasRqkaPuwnO5u2m1C-eqr-8l-Xo4Qpk7d4uFA8Y96GP1XStxDDzkanyc8uPGwQLGK4PRiZAAycDna4mjJlMcHNuYMNb778UKP-VEU1tE--Hn9JmmE29hQWImgvhktGdHVL-_iBtwgnQFdg9s8i_IdrmJU-eHuQIniONpuMQ)\n\n`Source: OneUpOneDown twitter account`\n\n`Source: OneUpOneDown twitter account`\n\n## Each week, Dzhuliana leads one of the breakout rooms set up to address a variety of topics.  The name of her breakout room is Catalyst Cardano Women, an initiative whose objective is to \"give women the confidence to take action and participate to their full potential within Catalyst, where they might otherwise have remained as an observer\".  An interesting and extremely disturbing statistic stands out in the information provided on the [Catalyst Cardano Women web page](https://cardanocatalystwomen.com/why-catlyst-women/): less than 5% of Cardano are women.
