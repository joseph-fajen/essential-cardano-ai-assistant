It provides a user-friendly interface to search, view, and retrieve information about transactions, blocks, addresses, and other data recorded on the blockchain.\n\nOn the Cardano blockchain we can use block explorers like [explorer.cardano.org](//explorer.cardano.org), [cardanoscan.io](//cardanoscan.io), and [cexplorer.io](//cexplorer.io).\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/82d304e7-b626-4573-ae34-86e8decf9e4a/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
