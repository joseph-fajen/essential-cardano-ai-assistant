The set of *Aiken validators* that make up the [MeshJS](https://x.com/meshsdk) solution can be integrated with other logics such as royalties, licensing, etc.\n\nThe logic behind the complex design of the *Content Ownership Smart Contract* is quite simple:\n\nWhen content is created (`Create Content` component of the Mesh Playground), the hash of the created content is included in the transaction. Also, it‚Äôs referenced in the transaction:\n\n`Create Content`\n\nthe Content Registry (a previously deployed validator‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`Send Ref-Script Onchain` component of the Mesh Playground).\n\n`Send Ref-Script Onchain`\n\nthe Ownership Registry (a previously deployed validator‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`Send Ref-Script Onchain` component of the Mesh Playground).\n\n`Send Ref-Script Onchain`\n\nthe NFT of the owner of the content that is in an Oracle contract (`Mint One Time Minting Policy` component of the Mesh Playground). This NFT was minted by the same owner of the content using a *one-time minting policy* created by the *dapp* creator (the owner of the *content* is not the same as the owner of the *dapp* that provides the *Content Registry service*. Note additionally, how the address in the ‚ÄúOperation Address‚Äù field is the same in all components‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääterminated in *e4cxr*).\n\n`Mint One Time Minting Policy`\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/880/1*MKJfrbXlPLWKr0MG9Am9Ew.png)Fig 1. `Create Content` transaction in Eternl¬†wallet.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/880/1*MKJfrbXlPLWKr0MG9Am9Ew.png)\n`Create Content`\n\nAlso, by providing the appropriate *TxHashes* as in 1, 2, and 3, they are also referenced in the transaction:\n\n4. the *token* related to the *Content Registry*  \n5. the *token* related to the *Ownership Registry*\n\n#### **Inspecting the¬†Datums**\n\nNow, notice how, upon inspecting the *datums* related to the *Content Registry* and *Ownership Registry* tokens after submitting a new transaction in the `Create Content` component of the Mesh Playground using the same information from the previous transaction (i.e., using the same ownership registry and the same content registry), you can see how they change given the increase in the number of content and ownership records.\n\n`Create Content`\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1320/1*ZK6ZBpkhOX3_FHHPDoEmsg.png)Fig 2. Datums of the Content Registry and Ownership Registry tokens, before and after a `create content` transaction.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1320/1*ZK6ZBpkhOX3_FHHPDoEmsg.png)\n`create content`\n\nBringing real use cases and building tooling that recreates them using the Cardano blockchain is a mission we will continue to go deeper into.\n\n#### \n\nNext¬†Steps\n\nGo to Mesh Playground and explore the contract demo: <https://meshjs.dev/smart-contracts/content-ownership>\n\nImagine other use cases where having a single source of truth about ownership of an asset can reduce or eliminate costs, conflicts, intermediaries, etc.\n\nBoth on-chain and off-chain codes are open-source and available on Mesh Github Repository:<https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/tree/main/packages/mesh-contract/src/content-ownership>\n\nüßë‚Äçüç≥Want to know what we are cooking for this Catalyst Fund 13 and give us your ‚ô•Ô∏èsupport to keep theüí°lights on?
