It is specifically built for running Marlowe contracts directly without needing a web browser or mobile app.\n\nJust as the cardano-cli tool enables plain transactions, simple scripts, and Plutus scripts, the Marlowe CLI tool facilitates the ability to interact with and develop Marlowe contracts. Users can measure transaction size, submit transactions, test wallet integrations, and debug validators. It provides a very concrete representation of Marlowe contracts that is quite close to what is occurring on-chain.\n\nUsers can create their own workflow that operates Marlowe, or their own toolset to wrap the Marlowe CLI tool in the way that developers have wrapped cardano-cli to create services such as libraries, faucets, and marketplaces.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this FAQ?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
