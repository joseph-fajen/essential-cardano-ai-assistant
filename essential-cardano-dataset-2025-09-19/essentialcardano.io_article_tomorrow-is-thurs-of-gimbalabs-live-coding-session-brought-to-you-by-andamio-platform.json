Or maybe, we'll make a 🏄‍♀️seasonal shift from the kind of guided-onboarding that we've been doing ↗️toward a more intentional collaboration. Please bring your intentions the next session - we'll have some time to align on what each of us wants to accomplish.\n\nZoom link: <https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZErceCqpzMtG9XldfuPnBQEus5MBivl9OZe#/registration>\n\nLooking forward to it! -------------\n\nAnd talking about intentional collaboration: do you know what will be the best platform to 🚣‍♀️learn-by-doing, 🫂collaborate, 🏗️contribute 🙋‍♀️and make decisions? [The Andamio platform](https://andamio.io). Coming soon.\n\n[![r/cardano - Tomorrow is Thursday of Gimbalabs 🏕️Live Coding session, brought to you by: Andamio platform](https://preview.redd.it/ghnur2gyi7zb1.jpg?width=1366&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65222aa5bb2e41d9e73af151ae6d7fb4e9f4e378)](https://preview.redd.it/ghnur2gyi7zb1.jpg?width=1366&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65222aa5bb2e41d9e73af151ae6d7fb4e9f4e378)\n\n![r/cardano - Tomorrow is Thursday of Gimbalabs 🏕️Live Coding session, brought to you by: Andamio platform](https://preview.redd.it/ghnur2gyi7zb1.jpg?width=1366&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65222aa5bb2e41d9e73af151ae6d7fb4e9f4e378)\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/525aaddb-0680-430e-9e83-696922568ba4/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this article?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
