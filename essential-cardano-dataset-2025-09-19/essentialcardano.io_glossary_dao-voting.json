Leveraging the decentralized nature of Cardano, stakeholders use their voting power, determined by their holdings of ada, to influence the direction and development of the ecosystem.\n\nThrough transparent and auditable voting mechanisms, such as [Catalyst](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/project-catalyst), stakeholders engage in democratic decision-making, shaping the future of Cardano's development, funding allocation, and protocol evolution.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/82d304e7-b626-4573-ae34-86e8decf9e4a/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
