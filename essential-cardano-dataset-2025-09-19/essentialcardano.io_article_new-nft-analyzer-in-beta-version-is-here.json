It is called [ADAmarket.io](//adamarket.io) and it is a free automated tool that analyzes nft metadata, trading data and calculates uniqueness and other properties.\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/cccedf3a-7b3b-4da3-88ac-7df363312293/-/preview/-/format/auto/-/quality/smart/)We are running the site more or less in silent mode, as it still contains a lot of things that need to be fixed, finished or new features added, for which we are still collecting data day-by-day, but as an early beta, why not now.\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/cccedf3a-7b3b-4da3-88ac-7df363312293/-/preview/-/format/auto/-/quality/smart/)\n\nWe are officially planning to launch within two months. We will be glad for any feedback on our [cardano cnft tool](https://adamarket.io).\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/b2d8ccbe-5460-4c02-bb23-7a2425b9affb/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this article?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
