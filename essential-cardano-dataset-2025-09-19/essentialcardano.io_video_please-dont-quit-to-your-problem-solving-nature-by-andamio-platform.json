It is built to enable people to onboard and contribute to collaborative projects so that they can make a meaningful impact. We envision a future where work is defined and delivered in ways that achieve the highest levels of human collaboration. Andamio consists of a learning-management platform and a contribution-management platform that work together to create unique pathways for organizations and contributors to align on meaningful work. It uses the Cardano blockchain to provide non-custodial ways for people to build a record of learning and contribution, and it allows organizations to collaborate in solving important problems. After prototyping and testing Andamio in 2023, we are now building Andamio for production deployment. Stay tuned for updates as Andamio continues to roll out.\n\n--- Follow Andamio:\n\nüó£ Oficial website:‚Å† ‚Å†<https://andamio.io>\n\nüìùRead the Andamio whitepaper at: [https://www.andamio.io/whitepaper‚Å†‚Å†](https://www.andamio.io/whitepaper%E2%81%A0%E2%81%A0)\n\nüêìX account: @AndamioPlatform\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/525aaddb-0680-430e-9e83-696922568ba4/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this video?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content‚Äîyour contributions are invaluable.
