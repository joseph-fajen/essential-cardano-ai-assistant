DReps, stake pool operators, and the constitutional committee are responsible for voting on governance actions. Any ada holder can register as a DRep.\n\nDReps will play a crucial role in the decision-making process within the Cardano ecosystem, contributing to the democratic nature of the governance model. Ada holders may delegate their ada voting power to representatives who they feel are best equipped (for example, through deeper technological expertise) to best represent their interests.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158074695?v=4)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
