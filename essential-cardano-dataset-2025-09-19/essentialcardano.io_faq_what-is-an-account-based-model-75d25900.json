In this model, assets are represented as balances within users’ accounts, and the balances are stored as a global state of accounts, kept by each node, and updated with every transaction.\n\nIn many respects, account-based chains (such as Ethereum) operate in a similar fashion to traditional bank accounts. The wallet's balance increases when coins are deposited, and decreases when coins are transferred elsewhere. This poses a security risk since the recipient’s address can be tracked to reveal its balances, which is not possible with UTXOs.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87934408?v=4)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this FAQ?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
