The Marlowe language is designed to be accessible by both developers and non-developers.\n\nSee ‘[How are Marlowe contracts special?’](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/how-are-marlowe-contracts-special-a4cfce25) for more details.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this FAQ?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
