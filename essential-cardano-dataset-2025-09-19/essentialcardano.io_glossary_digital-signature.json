Utilizing [asymmetric cryptography](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/asymmetric-cryptography), it involves the creation of a unique signature by the sender using their private key, which can be verified by anyone with access to the sender's corresponding public key. This process ensures that the message or transaction has not been altered and comes from the legitimate sender, enhancing security and trust within the Cardano blockchain network.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/82d304e7-b626-4573-ae34-86e8decf9e4a/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
