It includes examples of how to lock ADA and Tokens (NFTs) at a Plutus script address and then how to redeem them from the Plutus script address ... All from the front end. The project is bootstrapped with a Create React App, so it is quick to get started for those familiar with this front-end framework.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://s.gravatar.com/avatar/91b9598d0b93bbc630bc8db8912c97a1?s=480&r=pg&d=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.auth0.com%2Favatars%2Fdy.png)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this developer resource?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
