Great initiative guys!\n\nIt was a sweet experience to be part of this journey with some other great colleagues in LATAM. Thanks, Mauro, Lucas, and Alfred, for the invite.\n\nBy the way, one of my favorite quotes from the event, by Lucas Macchiiavelli (min 43:14): \"Our main task is to create leaders\". <https://cardanospot.io/live-stream/65fd8ffbc28566529110f3c6>\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/525aaddb-0680-430e-9e83-696922568ba4/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this article?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
