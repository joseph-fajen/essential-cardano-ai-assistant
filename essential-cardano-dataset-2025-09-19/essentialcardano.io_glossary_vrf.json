It's a crucial component for various applications, such as generating random numbers for lotteries and ensuring secure and unpredictable leader selection in proof-of-stake blockchain networks.\n\nOn the Cardano blockchain, it was used to select slot leaders in the Ouroboros consensus protocol, helping ensure that the selection of slot leaders is fair and unpredictable.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/82d304e7-b626-4573-ae34-86e8decf9e4a/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
