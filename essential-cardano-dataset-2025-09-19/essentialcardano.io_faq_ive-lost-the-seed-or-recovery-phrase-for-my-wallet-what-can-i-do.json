There are many products available that enable you to store your seed phrase in a way that it is safe even in the most extreme conditions. If you loose access to your wallet, maybe your phone or laptop breaks or is stolen, or maybe you have forgotten your spending password, restoring your wallet in a wallet interface using your seed phrase is the only way that you will be able to regain access to it.\n\nIf you have lost access to your seed phrase but still have access to your wallet then you should immediately create a new wallet, storing the seed phrase securely, then transfer all of your funds to your new secure wallet.
