The words in a mnemonic phrase are derived from a random source of entropy and can be used to restore access to the wallet and its associated funds if the original wallet is lost, stolen, or becomes inaccessible.\n\nWhen you create a Cardano wallet, the wallet software typically provides you with a recovery phrase. It's crucial to write this phrase down and store it securely because it is the only way to recover your wallet. Losing your recovery phrase means losing all your assets associated with the wallet.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/82d304e7-b626-4573-ae34-86e8decf9e4a/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
