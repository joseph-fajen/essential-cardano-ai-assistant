To foster the growth and adoption of this technology in the region, BSL brings together business owners, developers, companies, institutions, and regulators from Latin America and around the world. This event aims to create a novel ecosystem of value and trust by supporting and promoting industry-disrupting projects.\n\nFirst held in May 2018, BSL has gathered more than 50,000 people across all editions. This number is likely to increase considerably in the future, given Latin America’s increasing adoption of digital assets and blockchain technology.\n\n## Marshia Martinez represents IOG at BSL 2022\n\n[This year’s edition](https://www.blockchainsummit.la/bsl2022/) takes place at the Panama Convention Center in Panama City from July 6-8.
