[Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/) and [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/) are official Cardano wallets that are safe and secure for storing ada. They also provide users with a possibility to delegate ada to stake pools and earn passive rewards. Many other wallets also support ada.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this FAQ?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
