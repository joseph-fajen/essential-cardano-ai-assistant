Its objective is to make the blockchain more robust and [scalable](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/scalability), increasing [throughput](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/throughput) and reducing latency in block transmission.\n\nThe Vasil hard fork combinator saw the implementation of [block diffusion pipelining](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/02/01/introducing-pipelining-cardanos-consensus-layer-scaling-solution/) and added reference inputs, inline datums, and reference scripts through four key [CIPs](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/cip) ([CIP-31](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip31/), [CIP-32](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip32/), [CIP-33](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip33/), [CIP-40](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/216)).\n\nThese changes allow for the [network to process a larger number of transactions](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/03/21/increasing-the-transaction-throughput-of-cardano/), improving the consistency of block propagation times without affecting network performance.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
