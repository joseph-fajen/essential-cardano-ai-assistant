Developed by IOG, Daedalus is the open-source desktop software wallet of choice for storing ada. It's a full-node wallet, which means the full Cardano blockchain needs to be downloaded, and each transaction is verified for maximum user security.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this FAQ?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
