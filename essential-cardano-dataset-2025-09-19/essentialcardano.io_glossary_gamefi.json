GameFi combines the principles of cryptocurrency and blockchain with gaming, creating a new type of gaming experience that allows players to earn real-world value from their gaming activities.\n\nIn GameFi, players can earn digital assets such as [non-fungible tokens (NFTs)](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/nft) or cryptocurrency by participating in games or completing various in-game challenges. These digital assets can be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges or used to purchase in-game items or services. GameFi also offers players a more decentralized and transparent gaming experience, where ownership and control of the game assets are distributed among the players rather than being controlled by a centralized entity.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/82d304e7-b626-4573-ae34-86e8decf9e4a/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
