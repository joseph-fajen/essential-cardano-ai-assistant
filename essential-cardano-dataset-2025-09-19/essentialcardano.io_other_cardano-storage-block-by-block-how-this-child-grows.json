There is no need, as some other chains, to send redundant internal transactions every minute to keep the network running etc. But that's also why Cardano can't boast a ridiculous number of millions of TPS - because the network is really only running real transactions. Even the rewards from staking, as long as they are not collected from the reward address, take up no space on the blockchain.\n\nTake a look on [Cardano storage](https://cexplorer.io/storage) live.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/b2d8ccbe-5460-4c02-bb23-7a2425b9affb/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this other resource?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
