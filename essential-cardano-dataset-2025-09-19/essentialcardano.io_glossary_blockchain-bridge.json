Blockchain bridges facilitate chain [interoperability](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/interoperability) and can be either bidirectional or unidirectional. Tokens are locked on their native chain by either sending them to a smart contract or sending them to the wallet of a custodian. Then, the equivalents of those tokens are created on the target chain and issued at an address designated by the person who locked the assets.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://s.gravatar.com/avatar/86408a48026d8a4fae867056c440712a?s=480&r=pg&d=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.auth0.com%2Favatars%2Fbe.png)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
