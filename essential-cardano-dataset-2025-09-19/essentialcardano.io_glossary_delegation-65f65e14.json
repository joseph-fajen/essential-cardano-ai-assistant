This helps maintain a computer server to run a node on the Cardano [network](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/networking). In exchange, delegators receive a share of the pool’s total rewards. Delegating your ada is totally safe because no ada leaves the user’s wallet.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
