Transactions are transferred to the sidechain for processing and the results are sent back, thus taking the workload off the main chain. This improves speed, lowers execution fees, and increases overall throughput.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87934408?v=4)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this FAQ?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
