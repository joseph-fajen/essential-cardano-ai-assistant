Each epoch is divided into slots – a short period of time in which a block can be created. Blocks carry information about recent transactions and their data, and are linked to the previous and next block creating an immutable chain of records. A Cardano epoch includes 432,000 slots (5 days).\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this FAQ?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
