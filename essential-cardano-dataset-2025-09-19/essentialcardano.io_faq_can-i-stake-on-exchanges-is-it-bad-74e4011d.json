Is it bad?\n\nStaking on exchanges means that ada is kept on exchanges, which incurs security risks. Given that exchanges own a large amount of ada, this also poses a centralization issue. It is important for Cardano to maintain a healthy distribution of stake across many pool operators. The best way is to choose a stake pool that best meets the goals and values that a person supports and shares. You can discover multiple pools and their websites in Daedalus or use sources such as [adapools.org](https://adapools.org/), for example, to choose the pool for delegation.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this FAQ?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
