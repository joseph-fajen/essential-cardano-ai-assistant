All addresses carry a network-discriminant tag to distinguish between different networks (e.g., mainnet or testnet) and a proof of ownership (i.e., a proof of who owns the transaction output). Some addresses also carry delegation choices or script references.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
