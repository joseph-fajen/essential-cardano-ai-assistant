The ecosystem expands and evolves alongside (and thanks to) its community, which plays a vital role in Cardano's constant and steady growth.\n\nTo illustrate Cardano's journey, from its go-live date in 2017 to the present day, Input Output Global (IOG) has created a very extensive Essential Cardano Guide to the Ecosystem. This report offers a sort of bird's eye view of everything that makes Cardano one of the most versatile and usable blockchain development platforms in the world.\n\nThe Guide highlights some of the components, people, and projects that power Cardano's present and future. Neatly divided into clear and highly visual sections, the Guide takes the user on a flyover across the entire ecosystem.\n\n[Begin your own journey of discovery.](https://services.iohk.io/guide-to-the-ecosystem)\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AATXAJz55LHEQUSdQ9OrCWihs6SyZB5lES0uuJRlpaeL=s96-c)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this article?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
