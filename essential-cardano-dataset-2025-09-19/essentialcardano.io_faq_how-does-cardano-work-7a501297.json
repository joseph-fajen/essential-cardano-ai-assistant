This means that thousands of people’s computers (nodes) cooperate to agree if a transaction is valid. This process is enabled by the proof-of-stake [consensus](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-is-consensus) protocol [Ouroboros](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-is-ouroboros). On Cardano, people can send and receive ada (Cardano’s native currency), participate in [staking and delegation](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-is-staking-and-delegation-on-cardano) to earn rewards, create multi-purposed assets ([native tokens](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-are-native-tokens)) and [non-fungible tokens (NFTs)](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-is-a-non-fungible-token-nft). Cardano also has different smart contract languages and ensures increased security guarantees using the first provably secure proof-of-stake protocol Ouroboros.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this FAQ?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
