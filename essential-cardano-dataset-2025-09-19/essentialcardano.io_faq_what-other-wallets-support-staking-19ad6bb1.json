Note that some of them won't let you choose the pool you want. This means that you will be able to delegate your ada only to the pool that supports a certain wallet.\n\n## 6 contributors\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhS84tuz0i-1jlrDC7d-OyG_1pHWeDYkRcGu6T6=s96-c)\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhzkEO0CpzYgfaBhQB-NcClReZrniVd-1Xhubwt=s96-c)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Ggb2vc0z3hcvEUl4JVncfHpB3oUwvr_5LvBomSe=s96-c)\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiwHhW7zOGItpHdjaEFs6tuqF3oGsczMrKVe18_6g=s96-c)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this FAQ?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
