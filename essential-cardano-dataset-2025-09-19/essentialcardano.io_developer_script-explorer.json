That gave me the idea to create a tool, that makes all the awesome scripts on Cardano visible. So I applied for funding in Fund 9, but I was too impatient to wait for the voting results. Thus I built the alpha version of the Script Explorer.\n\nThere you can take a look at Timelock and Plutus scripts in detail and Sankey, this is quite insightful for a Smart Contract developer.\n\n[https://script-explorer.com/](https://script-explorer.com/#/)\n\nBest Regards\n\nQuirin Schlegel\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34195172?v=4)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this developer resource?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content‚Äîyour contributions are invaluable.
