They are used in various operations related to rewards, such as delegating ADA to pools, checking the reward balance, etc. Anyone who owns a stake address also owns a stake in any associated funds linked to that address. It's worth noting that stake addresses cannot be used for sending or receiving payments, unlike payment addresses.\n\nTypically, a stake address will start with 'stake1', for example: *stake1ux7k5ztvhwj7ykv5v7vwjjzdfckjk0v74z9p9m5w0t5534clf62eq*\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/82d304e7-b626-4573-ae34-86e8decf9e4a/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
