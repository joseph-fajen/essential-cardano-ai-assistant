In a liquidity pool, users deposit equal amounts of two different cryptocurrencies, which are used to create a market for those tokens. The price of the tokens in the pool is determined by an algorithm that maintains a balance between the two tokens based on supply and demand.\n\nIn exchange for providing liquidity to the pool, users receive a portion of the trading fees generated by the exchange.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/82d304e7-b626-4573-ae34-86e8decf9e4a/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
