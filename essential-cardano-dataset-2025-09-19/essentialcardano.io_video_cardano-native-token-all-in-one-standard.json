As the Cardano token is native, users do not need to pay any fees to transfer tokens.\n\nThird, it provides safety for Cardano's native tokens as they are managed by the ledger mechanism and have the same level of security as ADA.\n\nAll of the issues mentioned above will provide flexibility, simplicity, ease of use, and versatility for Cardano's native token. What do you think about these advantages?\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/82d304e7-b626-4573-ae34-86e8decf9e4a/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this video?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
