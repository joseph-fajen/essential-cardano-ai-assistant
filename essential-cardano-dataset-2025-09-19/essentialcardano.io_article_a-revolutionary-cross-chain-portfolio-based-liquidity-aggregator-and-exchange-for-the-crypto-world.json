There are many issues and barriers to gaining mass adoption across the entire cryptocurrency industry and we have a solution to provide cross-chain movement of assets without using bridges and wrapped assets.\n\n## Crypto Mass Adoption\n\nThe widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies relies on the seamless ability to hold, stake, and trade tokens in a convenient, reliable, and efficient manner. While centralized exchanges (CEXs) offer such user experiences, they often compromise the ownership of tokens, leaving users dependent on third parties and vulnerable to various risks. On the other hand, decentralized finance (DeFi) provides true ownership and full utility of tokens through non-custodial wallets and smart contract-based applications (dApps). However, the need for interoperability among different blockchains hinders the broader adoption of DeFi. The crypto industry increasingly focuses on interoperability, enabling blockchain networks to communicate and exchange data, messages, and tokens seamlessly.\n\n## Fragmentation and Siloed Ecosystems\n\nThe DeFi landscape is currently fragmented and isolated, with separate ecosystems on different blockchains. Each ecosystem has its own technological stack, infrastructure, protocols, wallets, and communities, limiting the potential of DeFi. While committed communities thrive within specific ecosystems, the broader adoption of DeFi suffers due to the barriers between these isolated ecosystems. The existing connections between ecosystems are often fragile bridges that enable token transfers through lock/burn- and mint mechanisms, resulting in wrapped and synthetic tokens. However, these bridges have proven less secure and susceptible to attacks, resulting in significant losses. To fully unlock the potential of DeFi, more efficient, reliable, and user-friendly connections are necessary.\n\n## The Issues of the Non-Interoperable\n\nIn addition to fragmentation, the need for interoperability presents liquidity-related challenges. Liquidity is dispersed, meaning only a fraction of assets is accessible to users. Availability depends on the affiliation with specific ecosystems and the preferences of the respective communities. This limitation restricts users' choices to tokens native to a particular blockchain and stablecoins. Moreover, liquidity needs to be more cohesive across different ecosystems, resulting in inefficiencies and obstacles in performing transactions. High fees and processing times further hinder the user experience in DeFi operations.\n\nFinancial risks arise from the dependency on DEXs, lending protocols, and other projects on the success of their ecosystems. The aggregated liquidity and overall ecosystem support determine the liquidity projects can secure. Technological risks emerge when adopting cross-chain approaches, as they must make decisions regarding the underlying system and the extent of their cross-chain development. Security risks are prevalent due to intermediaries, multiple interfaces, and potential breaches, jeopardizing the safety of funds and sensitive information.\n\n## The Trilemma of Interoperability\n\nSolving the challenges of interoperability requires careful trade-offs in terms of generalisability, extensibility, and trustlessness. Generalisability refers to the depth of interoperability, allowing various data transfers between chains beyond just tokens. It enables projects to function and communicate seamlessly, synchronizing data, tokens, smart contracts, and governance models across chains. Extensibility, on the other hand, focuses on the breadth of interoperability, enabling the seamless addition of new chains to an interoperable network. Each chain has its unique architecture and set of players, including bridges, wallets, and protocols. Lastly, trustlessness minimizes intermediaries' involvement in blockchain communication, ensuring users' control over their assets and actions. Reducing intermediaries and interfaces mitigates the risk of breaches and intrusive interferences.\n\n## Blueshift Brings an Answer for Interoperability to the DeFi Space\n\nBlueshift, a cutting-edge decentralized exchange (DEX), empowers users to trade cryptocurrencies seamlessly across multiple blockchain networks.
