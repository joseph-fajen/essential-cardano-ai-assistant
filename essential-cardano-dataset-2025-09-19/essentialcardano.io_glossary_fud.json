FUD can be used to discourage people from taking a certain action. The goal of FUD is to manipulate people's emotions and influence their behavior by making them feel anxious, uncertain, and doubtful about a particular situation or decision.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/82d304e7-b626-4573-ae34-86e8decf9e4a/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
