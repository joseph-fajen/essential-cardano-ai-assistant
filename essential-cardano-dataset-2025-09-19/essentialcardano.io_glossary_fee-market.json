Research continues to be done on how Cardano can evolve to offer a fair structure of [fee tiers](https://www.essentialcardano.io/article/network-traffic-and-tiered-pricing) that provides the best balance between managing demand and maintaining reasonable costs. Ultimately, the Cardano community will vote on whether or not to implement this tiered system.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
