The program has offered courses on building, simulating, analyzing and running smart contracts using Marlowe. The course has involved weekly videos, exercises, Q&A sessions, and access to the course creators and key experts in the field.\n\nThe Marlowe team is currently reassessing the strategy to educate and support Marlowe pioneers. Some pioneers did not complete the program, so the team will be investing in educational courses, programs, and workshops tailored to specific audiences.\n\nTo best shape the educational programs to your needs, please [send your input](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to tell what you think would be most helpful for you.\n\nTo hear about more upcoming educational opportunities as they emerge, please monitor [Discord announcements](https://discord.com/channels/826816523368005654/936295815926927390) and explore [IOG Academy](https://www.youtube.com/@iogacademy) resources.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this FAQ?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
