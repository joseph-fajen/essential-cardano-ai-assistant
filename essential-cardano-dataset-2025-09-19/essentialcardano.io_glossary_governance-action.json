It is an on-chain event triggered by a transaction. Governance actions have an expiration period, after which the action cannot be enacted.\n\nAny ada holder can submit a governance action for a vote on-chain. Once the action is recorded on the ledger, voters submit voting transactions.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158074695?v=4)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
