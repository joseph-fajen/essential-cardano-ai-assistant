A CIP has an expected format: the structure of the proposal is templated to facilitate discussion and review. This enables other community members to jump in and discuss specific proposals, or individual points in a proposal. The proposals and their history are publicly available and maintained on the Cardano Foundation [CIP GitHub repository](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs).\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87934408?v=4)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this FAQ?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
