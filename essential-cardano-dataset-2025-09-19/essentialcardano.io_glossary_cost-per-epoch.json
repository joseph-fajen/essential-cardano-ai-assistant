The cost per epoch is subtracted from the total ada rewarded to a pool, before the operator takes their profit margin. Whatever remains is shared proportionally among the delegators.\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this glossary?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our contentâ€”your contributions are invaluable.
