With more to share in the coming weeks, we’re kicking off our first show of 2023 with a number of updates from the projects building out this incredible ecosystem. We’re joined by EMURGO to talk about the launch of their USDA stablecoin slated for this year, and Marvin Bertin, CSO and co-founder of Genius Yield, and COO of Paribus Wilson Davis stop by for an update.\n\nAnd we’ve taken a closer look at the Edinburgh Decentralization Index announced at our IO ScotFest event late last year. Professor Aggelos Kiayias and some of the team share more on some of the key innovations this critical research initiative intends to bring to the wider blockchain industry. We’ve also shared a short clip from a long-form conversation between Charles Hoskinson and Aggelos where they touch on some of the key moments from the last six years of IOG’s research, and the importance of first principles when building for the future.\n\nFor all the latest news and updates, be sure to [follow IOG on Twitter](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqa2NQYzVld3hmTHVRbkMzeERzaG5qT0JUaDdtZ3xBQ3Jtc0tsVU5FYU1yTEQ2WFpiR0R1ZlBoU2xFbFkxSTg1ZmtzX3MzN3BkVDhDS0JnWlREMmZtRks4ekNUWlNDX0tIdXFIY3V6NnplYzBaUldRMmlKR2ZNNFkxOHNuLVg1cUVQcHhDRDFiRmNmUTRwTkU3WHc3NA&q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FInputOutputHK&v=IYv-W_qtnxo)!\n\n## 1 contributors\n\n![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102920475?v=4)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this video?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
