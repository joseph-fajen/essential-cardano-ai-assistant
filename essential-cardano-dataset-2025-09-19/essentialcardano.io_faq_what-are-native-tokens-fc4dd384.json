Users can create their own tokens that interact with the blockchain just like ada. Tokens can be [fungible](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-does-fungible-mean) (interchangeable) or [non-fungible](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-is-a-non-fungible-token-nft) (unique), and act as payment units, rewards, tradable assets, or information holders. There is no need to create smart contracts to handle native tokens, which removes a layer of added complexity and potential for errors.\n\n## 2 contributors\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/4f580f1c-e076-45b2-8a8d-af75d20c0cfd/)\n\n## Would you like to suggest changes to this FAQ?\n\nWe encourage you to actively participate in the creation and moderation of our content—your contributions are invaluable.
