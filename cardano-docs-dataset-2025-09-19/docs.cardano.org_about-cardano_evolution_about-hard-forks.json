In most blockchains, a hard fork\nindicates block changes or a change to their interpretation.\n\nTraditionally, when conducting a hard fork, the current protocol would stop operating,\nnew rules and changes would be implemented, and the chain would restart. It is important to\nnote that a hard-forked chain *will be different* from the previous version and\nthat the history of the pre-forked blockchain will no longer be available.\n\nThe Cardano blockchain hard forked from a Byron federated model to\na Shelley decentralized one in 2020. However, this hard fork was unique. Instead of\nimplementing radical changes, Cardano ensured a smooth transition to a new protocol\nwhile saving the history of the previous blocks. This means that the chain did\nnot change *radically*, instead, it contained Byron blocks, and after a transition\nperiod, added Shelley blocks. There was no fundamental restart point that erased\nthe history of previous activities.\n\n## What is a hard fork combinator?[​](#what-is-a-hard-fork-combinator \"Direct link to What is a hard fork combinator?\")\n\nA combinator is a technical term used to indicate the combination of certain\nprocesses or things. In the case of Cardano, a hard fork combinator combines\nprotocols, thereby enabling the [era-to-era transition](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/04/29/from-byron-to-shelley-part-one-the-testnets/) without system\ninterruption or restart. It ensured that Byron and Shelley ledgers appeared as *one*\nledger. Shifting from [Ouroboros BFT](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1049.pdf) to [Ouroboros Praos](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-praosan-adaptively-securesemi-synchronous-proof-of-stake-protocol/) did not require all nodes to\nupdate simultaneously. Instead, nodes could update gradually, in fact, some could\nrun Byron blocks, while others could run Shelley blocks.\n\nThe hard fork combinator is designed to enable the combination of several\nprotocols, without having to make significant adjustments.\n\nRead more about Cardano's upgrades in the following section.\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project.
