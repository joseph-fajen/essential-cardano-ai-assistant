Here, you'll find content\nthat describes and supports the features on both the Cardano mainnet and testnet\nenvironments.\n\nThis includes basic explainers for newcomers to Cardano, explanations of the\ncore features, details about Cardano's design and evolution, insights into how\nthe Cardano network operates, and platform architecture. You can also access\ndeveloper resources that explain the core concepts and provide links to\ndeveloper documentation for more technical tutorials.\n\nIf you are interested in building tools on Cardano, integrating with Cardano,\nand connecting with the wider developer community, please visit the\n[Cardano Developer Portal](https://developers.cardano.org/home/).\n\n## Cardano explained[â€‹](#cardano-explained \"Direct link to Cardano explained\")\n\nCardano is a decentralized third-generation proof-of-stake blockchain platform\nand home to the ada cryptocurrency. It is the first blockchain platform to\nevolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach.\n\nThe Cardano platform has been designed from the ground up and verified by an\nindustry-leading combination of top engineers and academic experts in the fields\nof blockchain and cryptography. It has a strong focus on sustainability,\nscalability, and transparency. It is a fully open source project that aims to\ndeliver an inclusive, fair, and resilient infrastructure for financial and\nsocial applications on a global scale. One of its primary goals is to bring\nreliable, secure financial services to those people who do not currently have\naccess.\n\nCardano has been designed with security as one of its founding principles. It is\nwritten in Haskell, a functional programming language. In a functional language\nlike Haskell, building your system using pure functions is encouraged, which\nleads to a design where components are conveniently testable in isolation.\nFurthermore, advanced features of Haskell enable employing a whole range of\npowerful methods for ensuring the correctness of the code, such as basing the\nimplementation on formal and executable specifications, extensive property-based\ntesting, and running tests in simulation.\n\nCardano's smart contract platform seeks to deliver more advanced features than\nany protocol previously developed and will serve as a stable and secure platform\nfor the development of enterprise-level DApps. Cardano's democratic governance\nsystem, being implemented based on\n[CIP-1694](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-1694) on-chain governance\nmechanisms, will enable the project to evolve over time and sustainably fund\nitself through a visionary treasury system.\n\nYou can read more about Cardano on the\n[official Cardano website](https://cardano.org/) and watch a summary of\nCardano's mission in this\n[explainer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_Nv0-PVrnM/).\n\nOn this page\n\n* [Cardano explained](#cardano-explained)",
