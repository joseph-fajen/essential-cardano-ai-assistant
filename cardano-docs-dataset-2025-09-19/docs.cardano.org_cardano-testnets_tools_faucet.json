While these tokens have no 'real world' value, they enable users to experiment with Cardano testnet features, without having to spend real ada on the mainnet.\n\n### To request tokens using the faucet:[​](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnets/tools/faucet#to-request-tokens-using-the-faucet \"Direct link to To request tokens using the faucet:\")\n\n1.   Select the desired action type:\n    *   Enter the account address where you want to top up funds\n    *   Enter the pool ID in bech32 format (`pool18ttg8k...a1c`) where you want to delegate funds\n\n2.   If you have been issued with an API key, please enter this to access any additional funds you may have been allocated\n3.   Click **Receive test ada**\n4.   Funds will be in the testnet account you specified within a few minutes.\n\n### Delegation[​](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnets/tools/faucet#delegation \"Direct link to Delegation\")\n\nIf you're an SPO and wish to test stake pool operations on preview or pre-production testnets, you can request some test ada to be delegated to your pool. For this, choose the environment you're working in, and select 'receive pool delegation' from the action menu.\n\nEnvironment Please select an environment\n\nAction Please select an action\n\nAddress (required)Please enter the address to send funds to\n\nAPI Key (optional)Enter an API key to bypass rate limiting\n\nRequest funds\n\nWhen you have finished using your test tokens, please return them to the faucet so that other members of the community can use them. You can return your test tokens to the relevant address:\n\n**Pre-production faucet address:****Preview faucet address:**\n\n[Previous Support and feedback](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnets/support-feedback)[Next Daedalus wallet for the Cardano testnets](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnets/tools/daedalus-testnet)\n\nOn this page\n*   [To request tokens using the faucet:](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnets/tools/faucet#to-request-tokens-using-the-faucet)\n*   [Delegation](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnets/tools/faucet#delegation)\n\n![Image 2: Cardano Logo](https://docs.cardano.org/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n\nMore About Cardano\n\n*   [Cardano Explorer](https://cardanoexplorer.com/)\n*   [Cardano Foundation](https://cardanofoundation.org/)\n*   [Cardano.org](https://www.cardano.org/)\n*   [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/)\n\nJoin the community\n\n*   [Cardano Community](https://cardano.org/)\n*   [Cardano Telegram](https://t.me/CardanoAnnouncements/)\n*   [Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/)\n*   [Cardano Blog](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/)\n*   [IOHK](https://www.iohk.io/)\n*   [IOHK blog](https://www.iohk.io/blog/)\n*   [IOHK YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBJ0p9aCW-W82TwNM-z3V2w)\n*   [Cardano Foundation YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbQ9vGfezru1YRI1zDCtTGg)\n*   [Cardano Foundation Twitter](https://twitter.com/Cardano_CF)\n*   [IOG Academy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX9j__vYOJu00iqBrCzecVw)\n\nFollow us\n\n*   [X](https://twitter.com/inputoutputHK)\n*   [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/iohk.io/)\n*   [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/IohkIo)\n*   [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/)\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nEmail* \n\n*   - [x] By checking this box, I agree to allow IOG to store and process the personal data submitted on this form in accordance with the IOG [Privacy Policy](https://static.iohk.io/terms/iog-privacy-policy.pdf)* \n\nCardano is an open-source project.
