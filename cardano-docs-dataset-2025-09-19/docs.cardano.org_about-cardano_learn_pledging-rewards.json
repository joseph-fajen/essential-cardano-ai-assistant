When you register a stake pool you can choose to pledge some, or all, of your ada to the pool, to make it more attractive to people who want to delegate. Although pledging is not required when setting up a stake pool, it can make the pool more attractive to delegators, as the higher the amount of ada that is pledged, the higher the rewards that will be paid out. The a0 protocol parameter defines the influence of the pledge on the pool reward.\n\nDistributing rewards[​](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/pledging-rewards#distributing-rewards \"Direct link to Distributing rewards\")\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDuring each epoch, rewards are distributed amongst all stakeholders who have delegated to a stake pool, either to their own stake pool, or another pool. These rewards are auto-generated by the protocol and are not managed by the stake pool operators (SPOs). Rewards come from two sources:\n\n*   All transaction fees: collated from the set of transactions included in a block that was minted during that epoch.\n*   Monetary expansion: involves distinguishing between the total supply of ada and the maximal supply of ada. The total supply consists of all ada currently in circulation, plus the ada in the treasury. The maximal supply is the maximal amount of ada that can ever exist. The difference between these two figures is called the _reserve_. During each epoch, a fixed but parameterizable percentage of the remaining reserve is taken from the reserve and used for epoch rewards and treasury, where the amount being sent to the treasury is a fixed percentage of the amount taken from the reserve.\n\nLearn more about rewards sharing in the [rewards sharing and pledge on Cardano video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAzyN3H8MOA&t=7s).\n\nThe following formula outlines how the reward mechanism works. The available rewards amount, transaction fees, plus monetary expansion, are denoted by R. First, the share of all available rewards that a specific pool can receive is determined, as follows:\n\n![Image 2: pledge_formula](https://docs.cardano.org/assets/images/pledge_formula-6f0c9a8bbfad3923058b99148f970609.png)\n\nThese elements are defined as follows:\n\n*   R - total available rewards for this epoch\n*   a 0 - pledge influence factor (can be between 0 and infinity)\n*   z 0 - relative pool saturation size, i.e. 0.5% based on a number of desired pools (k=200)\n*   σ - stake delegated to the pool (including stake pledged by the owners and stake delegated by others)\n*   σ’ = min(σ, z 0) - as σ, but capped at z 0\n*   s - stake pledged by the owners\n*   s’ = min(s, z 0) - as s, but capped at z 0\n\nNote that z 0, σ and s are all relative, so they are fractions of the total supply, as they all lie between zero and one.\n\nTwo important considerations are:\n\n1.   Rewards increase with σ, but stop increasing once σ reaches z 0, that is once the pool becomes saturated.\n2.   If a 0 (the pledge influence) is zero, this formula simply becomes R·σ’, so it is proportional to the pool's stake, up to the point of saturation. For larger values of a 0, the pledge s becomes more important.\n\nRemember that the pledge is declared during pool registration (alongside the cost and margin values), and has to be honored by the pool owners who are delegating to the pool. If they collectively delegate less than the declared pledge, pool rewards for that epoch will be zero. Note that the pool will be public if its operator margin is set to less than 100%.\n\nThe rewards that are produced by this formula are now adjusted by pool's performance: we multiply by β/σ a, where β is the fraction of all blocks produced by the pool during the epoch and σ a is the stake delegated to the pool relative to the active stake (ie, total stake that is correctly delegated to a non-retired pool).\n\nFor an optimally performing pool (a pool producing all the blocks that it can produce), this factor will be 1, on average. The actual value will fluctuate due to the stochastic nature, or random process of the [Ouroboros Praos](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/573.pdf) consensus algorithm.\n\nAfter pool rewards have been calculated and adjusted for pool performance, they are distributed amongst the pool operator and the pool members, or people who delegated part, or all of their stake, to the pool. This happens in several steps:\n\n*   First, the declared costs are subtracted and given to the pool operator\n*   Next, the declared margin is subtracted and given to the pool operator\n*   Finally, the remainder is split fairly (proportional to delegated stake), amongst all stakeholders who delegated to the pool, including the pool owners.\n\nThe actual amount of ada received in rewards may vary, and will depend on a number of factors including; the actual stake pool performance, that is, the number of blocks a stake pool is observed to produce in a given epoch versus the number it was _expected_ to produce. Changes to network parameters may also affect rewards.\n\n[Previous Delegation](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/delegation)[Next Consensus explained](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/consensus-explained)\n\nOn this page\n*   [Distributing rewards](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/pledging-rewards#distributing-rewards)\n\n![Image 3: Cardano Logo](https://docs.cardano.org/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n\nMore About Cardano\n\n*   [Cardano Explorer](https://cardanoexplorer.com/)\n*   [Cardano Foundation](https://cardanofoundation.org/)\n*   [Cardano.org](https://www.cardano.org/)\n*   [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/)\n\nJoin the community\n\n*   [Cardano Community](https://cardano.org/)\n*   [Cardano Telegram](https://t.me/CardanoAnnouncements/)\n*   [Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/)\n*   [Cardano Blog](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/)\n*   [IOHK](https://www.iohk.io/)\n*   [IOHK blog](https://www.iohk.io/blog/)\n*   [IOHK YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBJ0p9aCW-W82TwNM-z3V2w)\n*   [Cardano Foundation YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbQ9vGfezru1YRI1zDCtTGg)\n*   [Cardano Foundation Twitter](https://twitter.com/Cardano_CF)\n*   [IOG Academy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX9j__vYOJu00iqBrCzecVw)\n\nFollow us\n\n*   [X](https://twitter.com/inputoutputHK)\n*   [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/iohk.io/)\n*   [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/IohkIo)\n*   [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/)\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nEmail* \n\n*   - [x] By checking this box, I agree to allow IOG to store and process the personal data submitted on this form in accordance with the IOG [Privacy Policy](https://static.iohk.io/terms/iog-privacy-policy.pdf)* \n\nCardano is an open-source project.
