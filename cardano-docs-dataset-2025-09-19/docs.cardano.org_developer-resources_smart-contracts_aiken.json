It draws inspiration from various modern languages,\nlike Gleam, Rust, and Elm, renowned for their friendly error messages and an\noverall excellent developer experience.\n\nThe language is exclusively used for creating on-chain validator scripts. Users\nwill need to write their off-chain code for generating transactions in another\nlanguage, such as Rust, Haskell, JavaScript, Python, etc.\n\nAs a language, Aiken is purely functional with static typing and type inference.\nThis means most of the time, the compiler is smart enough to determine the type\nof something without requiring user annotation. It also allows the creation of\ncustom types resembling records and enums. Aiken does not include higher-kinded\ntypes or type classes because it aims for simplicity.\n\nOn-chain scripts are typically small in size and scope compared to other kinds\nof applications being developed today. Consequently, they do not necessitate as\nmany features as general-purpose languages that must tackle far more complex\nissues.\n\nAiken is easier than Plutus to get started with for those who are less familiar\nwith functional languages like Haskell. Similar to Plutus, Aiken scripts are\ncompiled down to the untyped Plutus Core (UPLC).\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project. Cardano is a software platform ONLY and does not conduct any independent diligence on, or substantive review of, any blockchain asset, digital currency, cryptocurrency or associated funds. You are fully and solely responsible for evaluating your investments, for determining whether you will exchange blockchain assets based on your own judgement, and for all your decisions as to whether to exchange blockchain assets with Cardano. In many cases, blockchain assets you exchange on the basis of your research may not increase in value, and may decrease in value. Similarly, blockchain assets you exchange on the basis of your research may fall or rise in value after your exchange. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Any investment in blockchain assets involves the risk of loss of part or all of your investment. The value of the blockchain assets you exchange is subject to market and other investment risks.\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY 4.0\n\nÂ© IOHK 2015-2025 - IOHK Supported Project",
