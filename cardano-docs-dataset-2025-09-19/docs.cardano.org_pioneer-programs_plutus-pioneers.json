Since Plutus contracts are Haskell programs, a basic understanding of Haskell is essential for the Plutus Pioneer program.\n\nTherefore, it is recommended that users complete this self-paced [Haskell Bootcamp](https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell-course?tab=readme-ov-file#haskell-course) course, which includes unique code examples, engaging exercises, and prepared solutions to learn Haskell fundamentals.\n\n## What is the Plutus Pioneer program?[​](#what-is-the-plutus-pioneer-program \"Direct link to What is the Plutus Pioneer program?\")\n\nIt is a program to recruit and train developers in Plutus for the Cardano\necosystem. When you join this program, you will become part of a group with\naccess to a set of lectures that teach you the core principles of how to code in\nboth Haskell and Plutus. It is highly interactive, with weekly videos,\nexercises, and Q&A sessions, along with exclusive access to the creators and key\nexperts in the language. You will also be able to join a dedicated community\nchannel, created to help pioneers connect with each other as you learn.\n\n## What prior experience do I need?[​](#what-prior-experience-do-i-need \"Direct link to What prior experience do I need?\")\n\nThis course is not for coding beginners. While you do not need to be an expert\nin formal methods, programming experience and a general aptitude for logical and\nmathematical thinking are highly desirable. Some prior knowledge of Haskell or\nfunctional programming is also recommended, as Plutus is heavily based on\nHaskell and includes advanced features like Template Haskell, type-level\nprogramming, and effect systems. We recommend that you work through **IO's**\nofficial [Haskell Course](https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell-course).\nYou can also read the [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) book.\n\n## What can I expect to learn?[​](#what-can-i-expect-to-learn \"Direct link to What can I expect to learn?\")\n\nThis course involves approximately ten hours a week of your time and effort. It\ncovers the building blocks of Haskell and Plutus, including:\n\nAs with all learning experiences, the more you put in, the more you will get out!\n\n## When can I join?[​](#when-can-i-join \"Direct link to When can I join?\")\n\nWe have recently completed a very successful fourth cohort of this program and\nwill be launching another course later this year. Please register your interest\ntoday using the form below to find out more details.\n\n## How can I register for the Plutus Pioneer program?[​](#how-can-i-register-for-the-plutus-pioneer-program \"Direct link to How can I register for the Plutus Pioneer program?\")\n\nIf you are interested in joining a future cohort of this program, please\ncomplete the registration form below and we will be in touch soon.\n\n## Will I be certified?[​](#will-i-be-certified \"Direct link to Will I be certified?\")\n\nYes, we are working on certification for those pioneers who successfully\ncomplete the entire program. Certificates will be represented as non-fungible\ntokens (NFTs) (on the testnet) and locked by a Plutus contract. Pioneers can\ndemonstrate their qualification by constructing an appropriate transaction to\nunlock their individual token.\n\n## Yes, I'm interested![​](#yes-im-interested \"Direct link to Yes, I'm interested!\")\n\n**[REGISTER NOW](https://services.iohk.io/plutus-pioneers-registration)**\n\nPlease share your details and we will be in touch.\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project.
