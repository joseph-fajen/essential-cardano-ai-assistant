Instead, they are pooled and then distributed to\nall pools that created blocks during an epoch.\n\nCurrently, there are no fees for the memory cost of tracking the accumulated\nchain state, in particular, UTXO.\n\n## Preventing economic attacks[​](#preventing-economic-attacks \"Direct link to Preventing economic attacks\")\n\nThe Shelley hard fork event meant that the Cardano blockchain moved from\nfederated to a fully decentralized environment, which might increase the\nincentive for malicious actors to perpetrate economic attacks.\n\nAn economic attack might occur where the costs incurred by the operators of a\nsystem are not covered by fees on the users of a given system. These situations\nallow users to impose costs on operators without paying the full cost\nthemselves, which could potentially lead to a severe drop in operator\nparticipation, and might ultimately lead to the collapse of the system itself.\n\nTo prevent this situation from arising, it is crucially important to address\nboth the existing unaccounted operator costs and the new costs.\n\nCardano's fee structure is quite simple.\n\nFees are constructed around two constants (a and b). The formula for calculating\nminimal fees for a transaction (tx) is a \\* size(tx) + b, where:\n\n* a/b are protocol parameters\n* size(tx) is the transaction size in bytes.\n\n## Protocol parameters (a and b)[​](#protocol-parameters-a-and-b \"Direct link to Protocol parameters (a and b)\")\n\nProtocol parameters are values that can be altered by Cardano's update system to\nreact and adapt to changes in transaction volume, hardware prices, and ada\nvaluation. Changing these parameters constitutes a hard fork, since it\ninfluences which transactions are accepted by the system.\n\n**Protocol parameter a**\n\nParameter a reflects the dependence of the transaction cost on the size of the\ntransaction. The larger the transaction, the more resources are needed to store\nand process it.\n\n**Protocol parameter b**\n\nThe value of b is a payable fee, regardless of the size of the transaction. This\nparameter was primarily introduced to prevent Distributed-Denial-of-Service\n(DDoS) attacks. b makes such attacks prohibitively expensive, and eliminates the\npossibility of an attacker generating millions of small transactions to flood\nand crash the system.\n\n**Protocol parameter x**\n\nx represents the size of the transaction in bytes.\n\nOn this page\n\n* [Preventing economic attacks](#preventing-economic-attacks)\n* [Protocol parameters (a and b)](#protocol-parameters-a-and-b)",
