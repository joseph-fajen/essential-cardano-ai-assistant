They are automatically executed by\neach Cardano node validating the transaction when the transaction attempts to\nmove funds from the script's address. The address of each script is derived from\nthe hash-sum of the compiled script.\n\nOnce deployed, smart contracts become immutable, which means they cannot be\nchanged. They are distributable and tamper-proof, fast, and cost-effective, as\nthere is no intermediary, which saves both money and time.\n\n## Tooling and languages[​](#tooling-and-languages \"Direct link to Tooling and languages\")\n\nCardano introduced smart contract support in 2021. As a multi-functional\nenvironment, Cardano now supports the development and deployment of smart\ncontracts using different programming languages. Here are some examples:\n\nDiscover more ecosystem\n[builder tools here.](https://developers.cardano.org/tools)\n\nFurther reading and related topics:\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project.

You are fully and solely responsible for evaluating your investments, for determining whether you will exchange blockchain assets based on your own judgement, and for all your decisions as to whether to exchange blockchain assets with Cardano. In many cases, blockchain assets you exchange on the basis of your research may not increase in value, and may decrease in value. Similarly, blockchain assets you exchange on the basis of your research may fall or rise in value after your exchange. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Any investment in blockchain assets involves the risk of loss of part or all of your investment. The value of the blockchain assets you exchange is subject to market and other investment risks.\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY 4.0\n\n© IOHK 2015-2025 - IOHK Supported Project",
