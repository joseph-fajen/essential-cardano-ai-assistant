It aims to provide a more balanced\nand sustainable ecosystem that better accounts for the needs of its users as\nwell as other systems seeking integration.\n\nThe first generation of blockchains (like Bitcoin) offered decentralized ledgers\nfor secure cryptocurrency transfer. However, such blockchains did not provide a\nfunctional environment for complex deal settlement and decentralized application\n(DApp) development. As blockchain technology matured, the second generation\n(like Ethereum) provided more enhanced solutions for writing and executing smart\ncontracts, application development, and the creation of different token types.\nOn the other hand, the second generation of blockchains often faces issues in\nterms of scalability.\n\nCardano is conceived as the third-generation blockchain as it combines the\nproperties of the prior generations and evolves to meet all the arising needs of\nusers. When comparing blockchain properties, many aspects should be considered.\nThus, the best solution must ensure the highest security, scalability\n(transaction throughput, data scale, network bandwidth), and functionality\n(besides transaction processing, the blockchain should provide all means for\nbusiness deal settlement). Moreover, it is important to ensure that blockchain\ntechnology is constantly developing in terms of sustainability and is\ninteroperable with other blockchains and financial institutions.\n\nTo address these needs, Cardano has been built focusing on such core concepts\nas:\n\n* **Scalability** – ensures that the Cardano network is capable of processing an\n  increasing number of transactions as user demand grows. Scalability also\n  provides higher bandwidth capabilities to allow transactions to carry a\n  significant amount of supportive data that can be easily managed within the\n  network. For these needs, Cardano is implementing various techniques (like\n  data compression for instance), and introduces such scaling solutions as\n  [Hydra](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/) and\n  [Mithril](https://mithril.network/doc/), for example. Read more about the\n  [research underpinning Cardano's scalability here](https://www.essentialcardano.io/article/an-analysis-of-the-research-underpinning-cardanos-scalability).\n* **Interoperability** – ensures the most multi-functional environment for\n  financial, business, or commercial operations by enabling users to interact\n  with different blockchain systems. Cardano aims to support cross-chain\n  transfers, multiple token types, and commonly used smart contract languages.\n  Read more about the concept of\n  [partner chains](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2023/11/03/partner-chains-are-coming-to-cardano/).\n* **Sustainability** – designing a proof-of-stake blockchain means it is vital\n  to ensure that the system is self-sustainable. To drive growth and maturity in\n  a truly decentralized manner, Cardano is built to allow the community to\n  maintain its continuous development by participating, proposing, and\n  implementing system improvements. This is now being implemented through\n  [CIP-1694](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-1694) on-chain governance\n  mechanisms.\n\n## Cardano advantages[​](#cardano-advantages \"Direct link to Cardano advantages\")\n\n* **Academic research** – formal methods, such as mathematical specifications,\n  property-based tests, and proofs, are the best way to deliver high assurance\n  software systems and give confidence to users for the management of digital\n  funds. Cardano has been built using formal methods to achieve strong\n  guarantees on the functional correctness of core components of the system. All\n  of the research and technical specifications that underpin Cardano are\n  publicly available, and all Cardano development activity is published online.\n* **System design** – Cardano is written in Haskell, a secure functional\n  programming language that encourages building a system using pure functions,\n  which leads to a design where components are conveniently testable in\n  isolation. Advanced features of Haskell enable employing a whole range of\n  powerful methods for ensuring code correctness, such as basing the\n  implementation on formal and executable specifications, extensive\n  property-based testing, and running tests in simulation.\n* **Security** –\n  [Ouroboros](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/06/23/the-ouroboros-path-to-decentralization/)\n  (the Cardano proof-of-stake protocol) establishes rigorous security\n  guarantees; it was delivered with several peer-reviewed papers presented in\n  top-tier conferences and publications in the area of cybersecurity and\n  cryptography.\n* **Energy efficiency** – Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain. In contrast to\n  proof-of-work blockchains,\n  [Cardano requires much less energy](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/08/17/why-they-re-calling-cardano-the-green-blockchain/)\n  and computational power. The Bitcoin network is secured through computers\n  doing ever-more-energy-intensive computations – proof of work – which is\n  unsustainable in the long term. Cambridge University has an online tool that\n  shows the [computers powering Bitcoin](https://cbeci.org/) already consume\n  more electricity than some countries, like\n  [Switzerland](https://www.bfe.admin.ch/bfe/en/home/supply/statistics-and-geodata/energy-statistics/overall-energy-statistics.html)\n  for example.\n* **Seamless upgrades** – traditionally, blockchains upgrade using hard forks.\n  When conducting a hard fork, the current protocol would stop operating, new\n  rules and changes would be implemented, and the chain would restart – with its\n  previous history being erased. Cardano handles hard forks differently. Instead\n  of implementing radical changes, the Cardano\n  [hard fork combinator technology](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/05/07/combinator-makes-easy-work-of-shelley-hard-fork/)\n  ensures a smooth transition to a new protocol while saving the history of the\n  previous blocks and not causing any disruptions for end users.\n* **Decentralization** – Cardano is maintained by over 3,000 distributed stake\n  pools that are operated by the community. All blocks and transactions are\n  validated by network participants without any reliance on a centralized\n  authority.\n* **Functional environment for business use cases** – Cardano is establishing a\n  foundation for global, decentralized finance to develop a range of DApps that\n  can run using functional and domain-specific smart contracts, providing\n  multi-asset tokens for any needs.\n\nOn this page\n\n* [Cardano advantages](#cardano-advantages)",
