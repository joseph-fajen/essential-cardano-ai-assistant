Stake pools are responsible for processing transactions that will be placed in the ledger, as well as producing new blocks. Stake pools are at the core of [Ouroboros](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/06/03/from-classic-to-chronos-the-implementations-of-ouroboros-explained/), Cardano's proof-of-stake protocol.\n\nTo be secure, Ouroboros requires a good number of stakeholders to be online and maintain sufficiently good network connectivity at any given time. This is why Ouroboros relies on stake pools, entities that are committed to running the protocol 24/7, on behalf of the contributing stakeholders that hold ada. The idea is that these resource holders can bring their resources (their stake) together and form a _pool_, where typically one holder is the operator of the pool and the rest are delegators. Typically, the stake pool operator (SPO) installs and runs software compatible with the platform (the server node), while delegators take a more passive role. They delegate their stake to the pool.\n\nWhile Ouroboros is cheaper to run than a proof-of-work protocol, running Ouroboros still incurs some costs. Therefore, SPOs are rewarded for running the protocol in the form of incentives that come from the transaction fees and inflation of the circulating ada supply.\n\ninfo\n\nFurther reading:\n\n*   [About stake pools, operators, and owners](https://docs.cardano.org/stake-pool-operators/about-stake-pools)\n\n[Previous Cardano nodes](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/cardano-node)[Next Delegation](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/delegation)\n\n![Image 2: Cardano Logo](https://docs.cardano.org/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n\nMore About Cardano\n\n*   [Cardano Explorer](https://cardanoexplorer.com/)\n*   [Cardano Foundation](https://cardanofoundation.org/)\n*   [Cardano.org](https://www.cardano.org/)\n*   [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/)\n\nJoin the community\n\n*   [Cardano Community](https://cardano.org/)\n*   [Cardano Telegram](https://t.me/CardanoAnnouncements/)\n*   [Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/)\n*   [Cardano Blog](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/)\n*   [IOHK](https://www.iohk.io/)\n*   [IOHK blog](https://www.iohk.io/blog/)\n*   [IOHK YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBJ0p9aCW-W82TwNM-z3V2w)\n*   [Cardano Foundation YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbQ9vGfezru1YRI1zDCtTGg)\n*   [Cardano Foundation Twitter](https://twitter.com/Cardano_CF)\n*   [IOG Academy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX9j__vYOJu00iqBrCzecVw)\n\nFollow us\n\n*   [X](https://twitter.com/inputoutputHK)\n*   [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/iohk.io/)\n*   [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/IohkIo)\n*   [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/)\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nEmail* \n\n*   - [x] By checking this box, I agree to allow IOG to store and process the personal data submitted on this form in accordance with the IOG [Privacy Policy](https://static.iohk.io/terms/iog-privacy-policy.pdf)* \n\nCardano is an open-source project.
