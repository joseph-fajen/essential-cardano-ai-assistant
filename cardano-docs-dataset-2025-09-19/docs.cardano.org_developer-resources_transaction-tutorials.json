It is commonly used to transfer ada or other tokens from one\nuser to another. Additionally, it can serve various purposes, such as token\ncreation, delegation registration to a stake pool, or interaction with smart\ncontracts, among others. The process to modify the ledger through a transaction\nis as follows:\n\n**Creating the transaction**. A transaction includes a set of data that\nspecifies how you intend to modify the ledger. The fundamental components of a\ntransaction include UTXOs, from which the funds are sourced, and destination\naddresses to which you want to send funds along with the desired amount of\ntokens. There are various tools available to assist in creating transactions,\nsuch as wallets and `cardano-cli`.\n\n`cardano-cli`\n\n**Signing the transaction**. A user who owns the funds to be spent must\nprovide authorization for the transaction through a signature. If the funds\nare held in a smart contract address, the authorization is carried out by\nexecuting the smart contract itself. Various tools are available to assist in\nsigning transactions, including wallets and `cardano-cli`.\n\n`cardano-cli`\n\n**Submitting the transaction**. For a transaction to be reflected in the\nledger, the user must submit it. These transactions are received by stake\npools, validated, and then added to the ledger within a block.\n\nEach transaction includes an identifier known as `TxId`, and after completing\nthese three steps, you can view transaction's content in the Cardano Explorer,\naccessible at <https://explorer.cardano.org>, for example.\n\n`TxId`\n\n## Transaction tutorials index[​](#transaction-tutorials-index \"Direct link to Transaction tutorials index\")\n\nIn this section, you will find tutorials on how to create:\n\n**For additional references, see**:\n\n**Plutus scripts**\n\nNote: For more information about Plutus, tutorials, and how-to guides go to\n[Plinth user guide](https://plutus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n**Vasil tutorials**\n\nThe tutorials below provide explainers of the CIPs introduced with Vasil\nfunctionality.

Cardano is a software platform ONLY and does not conduct any independent diligence on, or substantive review of, any blockchain asset, digital currency, cryptocurrency or associated funds. You are fully and solely responsible for evaluating your investments, for determining whether you will exchange blockchain assets based on your own judgement, and for all your decisions as to whether to exchange blockchain assets with Cardano. In many cases, blockchain assets you exchange on the basis of your research may not increase in value, and may decrease in value. Similarly, blockchain assets you exchange on the basis of your research may fall or rise in value after your exchange. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Any investment in blockchain assets involves the risk of loss of part or all of your investment. The value of the blockchain assets you exchange is subject to market and other investment risks.\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY 4.0\n\n© IOHK 2015-2025 - IOHK Supported Project",
