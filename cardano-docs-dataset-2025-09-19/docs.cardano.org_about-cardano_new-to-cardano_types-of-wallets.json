Storing digital assets on exchanges is highly discouraged.\n\nBlockchain wallets come in different forms, from desktop and mobile\napplications to hardware (USB-like) devices and paper wallets. All wallets are\ndesigned to enable the storage of digital assets and to allow the sending and\nreceiving of those. Technically, assets are not stored in the wallet ‒\ntheir records live on the blockchain and can be accessed using unique private\nkeys, which grant the right to make transactions. Losing your private keys means\nlosing access to your digital assets. That is why it is crucial to keep your keys\nsafe and offline.\n\nThe difference between the wallet types lies in their security and supported\nfunctionality. Paper wallets are the most secure, for example, but not as\nconvenient in use; some wallets support a limited number of assets, some\nlack certain features (like delegation, for instance).\n\nLet's take a closer look at the pros and cons of different wallet types:\n\n## Where to store ada?[​](#where-to-store-ada \"Direct link to Where to store ada?\")\n\nDifferent wallets support ada.

Cardano is a software platform ONLY and does not conduct any independent diligence on, or substantive review of, any blockchain asset, digital currency, cryptocurrency or associated funds. You are fully and solely responsible for evaluating your investments, for determining whether you will exchange blockchain assets based on your own judgement, and for all your decisions as to whether to exchange blockchain assets with Cardano. In many cases, blockchain assets you exchange on the basis of your research may not increase in value, and may decrease in value. Similarly, blockchain assets you exchange on the basis of your research may fall or rise in value after your exchange. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Any investment in blockchain assets involves the risk of loss of part or all of your investment. The value of the blockchain assets you exchange is subject to market and other investment risks.\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY 4.0\n\n© IOHK 2015-2025 - IOHK Supported Project",
