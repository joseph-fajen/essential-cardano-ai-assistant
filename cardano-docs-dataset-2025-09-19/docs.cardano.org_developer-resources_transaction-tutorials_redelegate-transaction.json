There can be multiple reasons to redelegate your stake, but the most common ones are:\n\nTo do that, you need to create a new certificate that you are sending in a transaction, as in the first part of the tutorial:\n\n`cardano-cli stake-address delegation-certificate \\  \n --stake-verification-key-file stake.vkey \\  \n --stake-pool-id pool1vzqtn3mtfvvuy8ghksy34gs9g97tszj5f8mr3sn7asy5vk577ec \\  \n --out-file new-delegation.cert`\n\nNow the delegation certificate contains the `--stake-pool-id` of the new stake pool. It means that you're ready to build your transaction, selecting the UTXO from which you will pay the fee:\n\n`--stake-pool-id`\n`$ cardano-cli query utxo --address $(cat payment.addr)  \n TxHash TxIx Amount  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n2b1bfc342c1f5531df4cfa220eac79574142c7263d97885d2ad8588ca1a7e22b 0 10016871698 lovelace + TxOutDatumNone  \nafb33e353a9880b7cbd9e5eb2cbffa024d1b3b938ee2c739e53dd187094e8f0d 0 10000000 lovelace + TxOutDatumInline ReferenceTxInsScriptsInlineDatumsInBabbageEra (HashableScriptData \"\\216y\\159\\CAN*\\255\" (ScriptDataConstructor 0 [ScriptDataNumber 42]))`\n\nBuild:\n\n`cardano-cli transaction build \\  \n --witness-override 2 \\  \n --tx-in 2b1bfc342c1f5531df4cfa220eac79574142c7263d97885d2ad8588ca1a7e22b#0 \\  \n --change-address $(cat payment.addr) \\  \n --certificate new-delegation.cert \\  \n --out-file new-delegation.tx  \n  \nSign:  \n  \ncardano-cli transaction sign \\  \n --tx-file new-delegation.tx \\  \n --signing-key-file payment.skey \\  \n --signing-key-file stake.skey \\  \n --out-file new-delegation.signed  \n  \ncardano-cli transaction submit --tx-file new-delegation.signed`\n\nIf you check your stake address details, you'll see that you have delegated your stake to a new stake pool and you have zero rewards for now:\n\n`$ cardano-cli query stake-address-info --address $(cat stake.addr)  \n[  \n {  \n \"address\": \"stake_test1uq954t492tmusk2dy9z505g3cz3sfpnh0swsqjmzk47rasqyn8uqp\",  \n \"delegation\": \"pool1vzqtn3mtfvvuy8ghksy34gs9g97tszj5f8mr3sn7asy5vk577ec\",  \n \"rewardAccountBalance\": 0  \n }  \n]`\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project.
