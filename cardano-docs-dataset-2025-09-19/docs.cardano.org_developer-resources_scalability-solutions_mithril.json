These snapshots can be useful in multiple use cases such as secure\nvoting, data exchange, and synchronization between applications, sidechains,\nlight wallets, etc.\n\nThe first application of Mithril allows faster bootstrapping of Cardano\nnodes. As each node has a full copy of the blockchain and needs to verify each\nblock from the history, it takes a significant amount of time to start a new\nnode from scratch. With Mithril, it is possible to start a node from a\npredefined state, with the same security guarantees that the chain itself\nprovides, but much faster.\n\n## Developer documentation[​](#developer-documentation \"Direct link to Developer documentation\")\n\n* [Mithril documentation](https://mithril.network/doc/).\n\n### Further reading[​](#further-reading \"Direct link to Further reading\")\n\n* [Mithril nears mainnet release](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2023/07/20/mithril-nears-mainnet-release/) blog post\n* [Mithril proof of concept is now open-source](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/08/29/mithril-proof-of-concept-is-now-open-source/)\n  blog post\n* [Mithril: a stronger and lighter blockchain for better efficiency](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/10/29/mithril-a-stronger-and-lighter-blockchain-for-better-efficiency/)\n  blog post\n* [Mithril: Stake-based Threshold Multisignatures](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/mithril-stake-based-threshold-multisignatures/)\n  research paper.\n\nOn this page\n\n* [Developer documentation](#developer-documentation)\n  + [Further reading](#further-reading)",
