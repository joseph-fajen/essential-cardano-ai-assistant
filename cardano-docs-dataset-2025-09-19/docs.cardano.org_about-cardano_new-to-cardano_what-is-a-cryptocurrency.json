It is otherwise\ncalled *crypto*.\n\nBlockchain ledgers serve as the underlying technology for cryptocurrency\ncreation in a decentralized environment. Blockchain protocols use rigorous\ncryptography techniques to enable the minting (creation) of cryptocurrency and\nto secure and verify crypto ownership and fund movement records. The price of\ncryptocurrency is not controlled by a government or centralized financial\ninstitution. It is defined by its value, correlation to real-world figures, and\nis driven by market supply and demand.\n\nAddresses are used when sending cryptocurrency payments. They are unique\nidentifiers and are represented by a string of numbers and letters that are\nobtained from the user's public keys.\n\n### Ada is the native currency of Cardano[​](#ada-is-the-native-currency-of-cardano \"Direct link to Ada is the native currency of Cardano\")\n\nEach blockchain ledger has its underlying cryptocurrency or native currency. Ada\nis the native, or principal currency on [Cardano](https://cardano.org/). This\nmeans that ada is the main payment unit on Cardano; it is accepted as\nfee-payment, to make deposits, and is also the only currency in which rewards\nare distributed.\n\nLovelace is the smallest denomination of ada. One ada = 1,000,000 lovelaces. Ada\nhas six decimal places, which makes it easily divisible into smaller fractions.\n\n### Native tokens[​](#native-tokens \"Direct link to Native tokens\")\n\nCardano also supports the creation of native tokens ‒ digital assets that are\ncreated for specific purposes. This means that users, developers, and businesses\ncan use the Cardano blockchain to create tokens that represent a footprint of\nvalue (whether defined by the community, market state, or self-governed entity).\nA token can be fungible (interchangeable) or non-fungible (unique), and act as a\npayment unit, reward, trading asset, or information holder.\n\ninfo\n\nRelated topics:\n\n* [Cardano monetary policy](/about-cardano/explore-more/monetary-policy)\n* [Learn about native tokens](/developer-resources/native-tokens).\n\nOn this page\n\n* [Ada is the native currency of Cardano](#ada-is-the-native-currency-of-cardano)\n* [Native tokens](#native-tokens)",
