Note, that you will also\nneed [to get some test ada](/cardano-testnets/tools/faucet) to test your\ntransactions.\n\n## System requirements[​](#system-requirements \"Direct link to System requirements\")\n\nThe Cardano node can run on the following platforms:\n\n## Installing the node[​](#installing-the-node \"Direct link to Installing the node\")\n\nDownload the latest version of the node:\n\nCheck your executables. The latest versions of the Cardano node and CLI can be\nfound here:\n\nThere are a number of ways to install and run a Cardano node on testnet. The\nchoice of the best-matching method depends on the operating system, level of\ntechnical expertise, and personal preferences.\n\nFor more information on the various options, see:\n\n## Configurations[​](#configurations \"Direct link to Configurations\")\n\nTo start working with the node, it is essential to ensure that the node\nconfiguration, genesis, and topology files are correctly set up. In addition,\nthe node will need the configuration files specific to each era that the Cardano\nnetwork has experienced thus far.\n\nThese configurations tell the node how to handle the updates that come with each\nera (ie, Mary, Alonzo, Babbage, etc). Each new era (implemented using the\nhard fork combinator technology)\nintroduces protocol changes and new ledger rules. While old configurations are\nstill valid, the new configurations and features offer new rules and\nimprovements. In the Babbage era, for example, Plutus V2 scripts work better\nthan Plutus V1 scripts. Plutus V1 scripts, however, are still supported.\n\nFor more details, see:\n\n## Working with the Cardano testnets[​](#working-with-the-cardano-testnets \"Direct link to Working with the Cardano testnets\")\n\nNote that mainnet and testnet commands are very similar except for the flag\nusage. For example, when interacting with cardano-cli on mainnet, you should add\nthe `--mainnet` flag. However, to use the same commands on testnets, you should\nuse the `--testnet-magic INTEGER` flag instead.\n\n`--mainnet`\n`--testnet-magic INTEGER`\n\n`INTEGER` indicates the number of the testnet:\n\n`INTEGER`\n`2`\n`1`\n\n### Creating keys and addresses[​](#creating-keys-and-addresses \"Direct link to Creating keys and addresses\")\n\nTo send and receive transactions, you should first create the payment key pair:\n\n`cardano-cli address key-gen \\  \n--verification-key-file payment.vkey \\  \n--signing-key-file payment.skey`\n\nThis creates two files: `payment.vkey` (the public verification key) and\n`payment.skey` (the private signing key).\n\n`payment.vkey`\n`payment.skey`\n\nBoth verification keys (payment.vkey and stake.vkey) are used to build the\naddress and the resulting payment address is associated with these keys.\n\nTo build the address, run:\n\n`cardano-cli address build \\  \n--payment-verification-key-file payment.vkey \\  \n--stake-verification-key-file stake.vkey \\  \n--out-file payment.addr \\  \n--testnet-magic INTEGER`\n\nTo query the balance of the address, run:\n\n`cardano-cli query utxo \\  \n--address $(cat payment.addr) \\  \n--testnet-magic INTEGER`\n\nFor more commands, see:\n\nNote to use the `--testnet-magic INTEGER` flag instead of `--mainnet`.\n\n`--testnet-magic INTEGER`\n`--mainnet`\n\n### Funding the address using a faucet[​](#funding-the-address-using-a-faucet \"Direct link to Funding the address using a faucet\")\n\nTo fund your testnet address, go to the testnets faucet and request some test\nada:\n\nIf you're working in a *pre-production environment* and have an API key, you can\nrun the following command to fund your address:\n\n`curl -X POST -s 'https://faucet.preprod.world.dev.cardano.org/send-money/YOURADDRESS?api_key=YOURAPIKEY'`\n\n`curl -X POST -s 'https://faucet.preprod.world.dev.cardano.org/send-money/YOURADDRESS?api_key=YOURAPIKEY'`\n\n### Creating, signing, and submitting transactions[​](#creating-signing-and-submitting-transactions \"Direct link to Creating, signing, and submitting transactions\")\n\nYou’re now ready to create, sign, and submit transactions on testnets.
