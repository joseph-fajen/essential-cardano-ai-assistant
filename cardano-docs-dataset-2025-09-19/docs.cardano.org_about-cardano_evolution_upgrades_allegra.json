However, it was significant since it prepared the platform for smart contracts and the creation of assets (in addition to ada) that run on Cardano. It also provided an important piece of Voltaire (governance) functionality, supporting a voting mechanism.\n\nToken locking is a way of recording that a specific token is being used for some purpose. Locking, in this case, means ‘reserving’ a certain number of tokens for a specified period of time so they cannot be disposed of to gain a benefit (such as voting, or running a smart contract).\n\nRead more about token locking [in this blog post.](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/12/02/goguen-brings-token-locking-to-cardano/)\n\n## Token locking use cases[​](#token-locking-use-cases \"Direct link to Token locking use cases\")\n\nSupport for token locking is crucial to enable complex deal settlement and funds accounting.\n\nIt can be used in the following scenarios:\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project.
