Networking will keep evolving with future\nadditions such as Ouroboros Genesis and peer-sharing. See\n[this explainer](/about-cardano/explore-more/cardano-network/p2p-networking) for\nmore details about network evolution and P2P.\n\nIn a previous hybrid setup, SPOs could configure a node to connect to, for\nexample, 50 other SPO nodes. This is a pretty large number, since many nodes can\nbe offline, change their addresses, etc. While 20 connections are enough for\nefficient communication, SPOs had to over-provision because of the static\nconfiguration.\n\nIn a Dynamic P2P setup, SPOs can target to configure 20 connections, which can\nbe picked from thousands of SPO relays, not just 50. And if any are offline, or\ngo offline, the setup will automatically pick new ones, to meet the set target.\nThis means that the configuration is no longer limited to a static pool of 50\npeers.\n\n## Connecting core and relay nodes[​](#connecting-core-and-relay-nodes \"Direct link to Connecting core and relay nodes\")\n\nAs a stake pool operator, you will have two types of nodes: core nodes and relay\nnodes. Each core node must be accompanied by one or more relay nodes.\n\nThe difference between the two types is that core nodes are responsible for\nproducing blocks, while relays are responsible for communicating with other\nrelays in the network and broadcasting blocks. This difference determines how\nthey are configured and how they are connected to the network.\n\nA core node is configured with various key pairs and an operational certificate\nrequired for block generation. It only connects to its relay nodes.\n\nDeveloper resources:\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project.
