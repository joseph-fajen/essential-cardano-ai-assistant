Minting refers to the process of 'producing new tokens, either as part of an initial coin offering (ICO) or ongoing token issuance'. Minting transactions enable users to generate or burn tokens according to predefined rules. This tutorial explores the details of minting transactions on Cardano.\n\nConsider a scenario where Bob wants to give Alice a token, but only Bob has the minting authority for that token. To achieve this, Bob needs to create a script that defines the minting and burning rules. There are two approaches to accomplish this: using Plutus policy scripts or simple multi-signature scripts. In this case, the tutorial suggests using a simple multi-signature script since the rule is straightforward: only Bob can mint the token.\n\nBefore you begin, ensure that you have all the necessary components ready. First, you need to generate new keys for the script itself. The process for obtaining script keys is as follows:\n\n`$ cardano-cli address key-gen \\    --verification-key-file transactions-tutorial-policy/policy.vkey \\    --signing-key-file transactions-tutorial-policy/policy.skey`\n\nBefore creating the script, you need to get the key hash of the new keys:\n\n`$ cardano-cli address key-hash \\    --payment-verification-key-file transactions-tutorial-policy/policy.vkey8ebd5f9c84fc25ae4506c7d0b687b2f7e82fe3f891036833e7f25c9b`\n\nYou can now create the script by writing the following code into `transactions-tutorial-policy/policy.script`:\n\n`{    “keyHash”: “8ebd5f9c84fc25ae4506c7d0b687b2f7e82fe3f891036833e7f25c9b”,    “type”: “sig”}`\n\nYou can get the `PolicyId` with the following command:\n\n`$ cardano-cli transaction policyid \\    --script-file transactions-tutorial-policy/policy.script C38b0924e32e677f7787f0a0247b177588ec135db927688d8a63310a`\n\nIt is also helpful to store it in an environment variable:\n\n`export POLICY_ID=C38b0924e32e677f7787f0a0247b177588ec135db927688d8a63310a`\n\nNow, you need to create a token name, which has to be in hexadecimal (54657374546F6B656E):\n\n`export TOKEN_NAME=54657374546F6B656E`\n\nBuild the transaction:\n\n`cardano-cli transaction build \\    --tx-in f947f84f1156995afd695247a8dc8a508fd40d371ce0afb801029769a0104874#0 \\    --mint \"1 $(echo $POLICY_ID).$(echo $TOKEN_NAME)\" \\    --testnet-magic 1 \\    --change-address $(cat bob.addr) \\    --mint-script-file ../cardano/transactions-tutorial-policy/policy.script \\    --out-file minting.tx \\    --tx-out \"$(cat alice.addr)+1047330+1 $(echo $POLICY_ID).$(echo $TOKEN_NAME)\"`\n\n[Previous Transaction tutorials](https://docs.cardano.org/developer-resources/transaction-tutorials)[Next Staking transactions](https://docs.cardano.org/developer-resources/transaction-tutorials/stake-transaction)\n\n![Image 2: Cardano Logo](https://docs.cardano.org/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n\nMore About Cardano\n\n*   [Cardano Explorer](https://cardanoexplorer.com/)\n*   [Cardano Foundation](https://cardanofoundation.org/)\n*   [Cardano.org](https://www.cardano.org/)\n*   [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/)\n\nJoin the community\n\n*   [Cardano Community](https://cardano.org/)\n*   [Cardano Telegram](https://t.me/CardanoAnnouncements/)\n*   [Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/)\n*   [Cardano Blog](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/)\n*   [IOHK](https://www.iohk.io/)\n*   [IOHK blog](https://www.iohk.io/blog/)\n*   [IOHK YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBJ0p9aCW-W82TwNM-z3V2w)\n*   [Cardano Foundation YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbQ9vGfezru1YRI1zDCtTGg)\n*   [Cardano Foundation Twitter](https://twitter.com/Cardano_CF)\n*   [IOG Academy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX9j__vYOJu00iqBrCzecVw)\n\nFollow us\n\n*   [X](https://twitter.com/inputoutputHK)\n*   [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/iohk.io/)\n*   [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/IohkIo)\n*   [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/)\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nEmail* \n\n*   - [x] By checking this box, I agree to allow IOG to store and process the personal data submitted on this form in accordance with the IOG [Privacy Policy](https://static.iohk.io/terms/iog-privacy-policy.pdf)* \n\nCardano is an open-source project.
