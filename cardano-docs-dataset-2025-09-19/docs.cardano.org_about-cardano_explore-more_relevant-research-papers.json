As a\nproof-of-stake blockchain, it is built with the rigor of high-assurance formal\ndevelopment methods and aims to achieve the scalability, interoperability, and\nsustainability needed for real-world applications. Cardano is the first platform\nto evolve out of scientific philosophy based on discovery, peer review, and\ncryptographic research.\n\nBuilding a strong foundation in the blockchain industry, Cardano has an ethos of\nopenness and transparency. All the\n[research and technical specifications](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/)\nthat underpin Cardano are publicly published and available to the community.\n\nCardano’s development roadmap is divided into 5 eras that focus on the\nfoundation, decentralization, smart-contract and multi-asset ledger deployment,\nscalability, and governance of a pioneering blockchain environment. Relevant\nresearch papers and specifications according to the Cardano development roadmap\nare outlined below.\n\n## Byron[​](#byron \"Direct link to Byron\")\n\nA period dedicated to building a foundational federated network that enabled the\npurchase and sale of ada.
