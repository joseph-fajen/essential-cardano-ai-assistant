Cold keys must be secure and should not reside\non a device that has internet connectivity. It is recommended that you have\nmultiple backups of your cold keys.\n\nThe keys that you need as a stake pool operator are:\n\nThe KES key, or hot key as mentioned above, is a node operational key that\nauthenticates who you are. You specify the validity of the KES key using the\nstart time and key period parameters and this KES key needs to be updated every\n90 days. The VRF key is a signing verification key and is stored within the\noperational certificate.\n\nDeveloper resources:\n\n## Creating an operational certificate and registering a stake pool[​](#creating-an-operational-certificate-and-registering-a-stake-pool \"Direct link to Creating an operational certificate and registering a stake pool\")\n\nStake pool operators must provide an operational certificate to verify that the\npool has the authority to run. The certificate includes the operator’s signature\nand important information about the pool (addresses, keys, etc.)\n\nOperational certificates represent the link between the operator’s offline key\nand their operational key. A certificate’s job is to check whether or not an\noperational key is valid, to prevent malicious interference. The certificate\nidentifies the current operational key, and is signed by the offline key.\n\nCertificates are generated with an issue counter number and included in the\nheader of each block the node generates.\n\nCertificates include a kes-period (start date), which indicates the period\nwithin which the certificate is valid before you need to create another one.\n\nCertificates are generated on the offline machine using the offline/cold keys,\nbefore being copied over to the node to validate the KES keys used to sign the\nblocks.\n\nDeveloper resources:\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project.
