It introduced\nnative token and multi-asset support on Cardano. Mary allowed users to create\nuniquely defined (custom) tokens and carry out transactions with them directly\non the Cardano blockchain.\n\nWith the Mary upgrade, the ledger’s accounting infrastructure processes not only\nada transactions but also transactions that simultaneously carry several asset\ntypes. Native support grants distinct advantages for developers as there is no\nneed to create smart contracts to handle custom token creation or transactions.\nInstead, the accounting ledger tracks the ownership and transfer of assets,\nremoving extra complexity and potential for manual errors, while ensuring\nsignificant cost efficiency.\n\nDevelopers, businesses, and applications can create general purpose (fungible)\nor specialized (non-fungible) tokens to achieve commercial or business\nobjectives. These might include the creation of custom payment tokens or rewards\nfor decentralized applications; stablecoins pegged to other currencies; or\nunique assets that represent intellectual property. All these assets can then be\ntraded, exchanged, or used as payment for products or services.\n\nFurther reading:\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project.
