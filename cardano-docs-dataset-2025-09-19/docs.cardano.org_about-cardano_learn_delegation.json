Stake delegation is a mechanism\ninherent in the [Ouroboros protocol](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/889.pdf) that\nallows the protocol to scale even in a setting where the set of stakeholders\nmight be highly fragmented.\n\nAnyone who owns ada can participate in stake delegation while retaining their\nspending power. Note that you can spend your ada normally at any time,\nregardless of how you delegated it. This mechanism will enable stakeholders to\nparticipate in the slot leader election process in each epoch.\n\nStake delegation gives rise to *stake pools* that act similarly to mining pools\nin the Bitcoin protocol. Stake pool operators (SPOs) *must* be online to\ngenerate blocks if they are selected as slot leaders.\n\nThere are three options ada holders can consider for delegating their stake:\n\nIf you are not familiar with Cardano CLI or stake pool operations, see\n[delegation tips here.](/about-cardano/new-to-cardano/how-to-delegate)\n\n## Stake delegation requirements[​](#stake-delegation-requirements \"Direct link to Stake delegation requirements\")\n\nDelegating stake requires posting two certificates to the chain: a staking\naddress registration, and a delegation certificate. Posting certificates\nrequires funds, so a user setting up their first wallet will need a\nbootstrapping mechanism. This mechanism relies on the possibility of base\naddresses using a\n[staking key](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-rosetta/tree/master/examples#staking-key-registration-and-delegation)\nbefore posting the registration certificate for that key. Note that the stake\naddress can be based either on a single key or on a script such as\nmulti-sig.\n\n## Delegation scheme[​](#delegation-scheme \"Direct link to Delegation scheme\")\n\nWith the concept of delegation, any stakeholder can allow a stake pool to\ngenerate blocks for the Cardano network. Then the protocol will distribute the\nrewards to all participants, including the fees for the SPO. A stakeholder\ndelegates to a particular pool ID, which is the hash of the operator's\n[verification key](/about-cardano/learn/cardano-keys#vrf-keys).\n\nTo limit the delegate’s block generation power to a certain range of epochs and\nslots, the stakeholder can limit the proxy signing key’s valid message space to\nstrings ending with a slot number in a specific range of values. This simple\nscheme is secure due to the verifiability and prevention of misuse properties of\nproxy signature schemes. This ensures that any stakeholder can verify that a\nproxy signing key was actually issued by a specific stakeholder to a specific\ndelegate, and that the delegate can only use these keys to sign messages inside\nthe key’s valid message space, respectively.\n\nThe funds belonging to one staking key of a user’s wallet require posting a\nsingle transaction, containing a delegation certificate. This will only incur\nthe usual transaction fees. In particular, a stakeholder needs to pay a deposit\nfor registering a stake address and not for the stake delegation itself. Once a\nstake address is registered, the stakeholder will only pay fees to set the\ndelegation choice.\n\nNote that the stakeholder's stake will count for the pool's stake during the\nreward calculation.\n\n## Stake delegation scenario[​](#stake-delegation-scenario \"Direct link to Stake delegation scenario\")\n\nImagine a user who is about to receive their first ada, through redemption, from\na trade on an exchange, or some other source. They will set up a new wallet, and\ncreate an address to receive those funds. This address will be a base address,\nusing a staking key that is generated by the wallet, but not yet registered on\nthe chain.\n\nAfter receiving the initial funds, the user can then participate in staking, by\nposting a staking key registration certificate, and a delegation certificate for\ntheir staking key. Once the key is registered, newly created addresses can be\npointer addresses to the staking key registration certificate.\n\nRelated topics:\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project.
