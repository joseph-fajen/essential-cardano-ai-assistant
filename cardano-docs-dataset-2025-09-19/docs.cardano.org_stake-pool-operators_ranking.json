Ranking shows pool saturation level, simplifying the pool choice. From a\ndelegator's perspective, once a pool reaches a certain saturation point, it will\nno longer be beneficial to delegate to it. The most attractive stake pools are\ndisplayed first and ordered from the top down.\n\nThe ranking system is designed to provide users with the ability to choose the\nmost suitable stake pool for a higher return on investment (ROI), so reliable\nstake pool operators can maintain and support the system and maximize\ndecentralization.\n\n### Ranking parameters[​](#ranking-parameters \"Direct link to Ranking parameters\")\n\nA pool's ranking is based on several parameters: cost and margin, the pool's\nperformance, and the amount of stake that the pool has already accumulated.\nThese factors promote reliable stake pools that are not yet saturated and\nprovide low cost and margin.\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project.
