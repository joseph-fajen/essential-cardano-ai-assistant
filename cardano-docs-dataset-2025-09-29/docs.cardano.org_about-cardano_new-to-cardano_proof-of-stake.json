Think of consensus as a ruleset that each\nnetwork participant adheres to. As blockchains are not controlled by any single,\ncentral authority, a consensus protocol is used instead to allow distributed\nnetwork participants to agree on the *history* of the network captured on the\nblockchain – to reach consensus on what has happened, and continue from a single\nsource of truth.\n\nCardano is built on the ground-breaking PoS consensus protocol\n[Ouroboros](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/06/03/from-classic-to-chronos-the-implementations-of-ouroboros-explained/),\nand the first blockchain consensus protocol to be developed through\npeer-reviewed research. At the heart of the protocol are\n[stake pools](/about-cardano/learn/stake-pools), reliable server nodes run by a\nstake pool operator to which ada holders can delegate their stake. Stake pools\nare used to ensure that everyone can participate in the protocol, regardless of\ntechnical experience or availability to keep a node running. These stake pools\nfocus on maintenance and hold the combined stake of various stakeholders in a\nsingle entity.\n\n## How does proof of stake compare to proof of work protocols?[​](#how-does-proof-of-stake-compare-to-proof-of-work-protocols \"Direct link to How does proof of stake compare to proof of work protocols?\")\n\nIn contrast, proof of work (PoW) is a synchronous protocol that encourages\nminers to compete to be the first who can solve any problems within the block. A\nrewards system is used to incentivize this problem-solving. However, this\napproach comes at a cost, with increased electricity usage and longer time spans\nto solve problems within the chain. These factors can slow the network down\nsignificantly and means it is costly to maintain.\n\n## Features of proof of stake[​](#features-of-proof-of-stake \"Direct link to Features of proof of stake\")\n\nOne of the key features of PoS is that as a user's value increases, the\nopportunity to maintain the ledger also increases. This means a higher chance to\nproduce new blocks that can be added to the blockchain and timestamped\naccordingly. The creator of a new block is chosen based on a combination of\nrandom selection and a determination of their stake, or wealth. A type of leader\nelection occurs within the chain. It is worth remembering that within a proof of\nstake protocol, participants accumulate the transaction fees thereby adding to\ntheir wealth as they go. This approach encourages steady and stable growth of\nthe blockchain and reduces the instances of stalled transactions that can\nprevent chain growth.\n\n## Primary advantages of proof of stake[​](#primary-advantages-of-proof-of-stake \"Direct link to Primary advantages of proof of stake\")\n\nSome of the primary advantages of PoS over PoW include:\n\n* rigorous security protocols are incorporated into a PoS protocol\n* reduced centralization - the risk of centralization is reduced by issuing\n  penalties for selfish practices within the network\n* energy efficiency - energy consumption is extremely efficient as a smaller\n  amount of electricity, as well as hardware resources, are needed to produce\n  and run the blockchain\n* cost efficiencies - PoS currencies are far more cost-effective than those\n  operating on PoW protocols.\n\nOn this page\n\n* [How does proof of stake compare to proof of work protocols?](#how-does-proof-of-stake-compare-to-proof-of-work-protocols)\n* [Features of proof of stake](#features-of-proof-of-stake)\n* [Primary advantages of proof of stake](#primary-advantages-of-proof-of-stake)",
