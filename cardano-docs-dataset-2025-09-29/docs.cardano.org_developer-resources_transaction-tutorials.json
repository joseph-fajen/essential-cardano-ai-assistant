It is commonly used to transfer ada or other tokens from one user to another. Additionally, it can serve various purposes, such as token creation, delegation registration to a stake pool, or interaction with smart contracts, among others. The process to modify the ledger through a transaction is as follows:\n\n*   **Creating the transaction**. A transaction includes a set of data that specifies how you intend to modify the ledger. The fundamental components of a transaction include UTXOs, from which the funds are sourced, and destination addresses to which you want to send funds along with the desired amount of tokens. There are various tools available to assist in creating transactions, such as wallets and `cardano-cli`.\n\n*   **Signing the transaction**. A user who owns the funds to be spent must provide authorization for the transaction through a signature. If the funds are held in a smart contract address, the authorization is carried out by executing the smart contract itself. Various tools are available to assist in signing transactions, including wallets and `cardano-cli`.\n\n*   **Submitting the transaction**. For a transaction to be reflected in the ledger, the user must submit it. These transactions are received by stake pools, validated, and then added to the ledger within a block.\n\nEach transaction includes an identifier known as `TxId`, and after completing these three steps, you can view transaction's content in the Cardano Explorer, accessible at [https://explorer.cardano.org](https://explorer.cardano.org/), for example.\n\nTransaction tutorials index[​](https://docs.cardano.org/developer-resources/transaction-tutorials#transaction-tutorials-index \"Direct link to Transaction tutorials index\")\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this section, you will find tutorials on how to create:\n\n*   [Minting transactions](https://docs.cardano.org/developer-resources/transaction-tutorials/minting-transaction)\n*   [Staking transactions](https://docs.cardano.org/developer-resources/transaction-tutorials/stake-transaction)\n*   [Withdrawing transactions](https://docs.cardano.org/developer-resources/transaction-tutorials/withdraw-transaction)\n*   [Transactions with funds redelegation](https://docs.cardano.org/developer-resources/transaction-tutorials/redelegate-transaction)\n*   [Transactions for multiple purposes](https://docs.cardano.org/developer-resources/transaction-tutorials/multiple-purposes)\n\n**For additional references, see**:\n\n*   [Building and signing transactions](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-wiki/blob/main/docs/reference/building-and-signing-tx.md)\n*   [Diagnosing transaction problems and troubleshooting](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-wiki/blob/main/docs/reference/diagnosing-transactions.md)\n*   [Transaction metadata](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-wiki/blob/main/docs/reference/tx-metadata.md)\n*   [Simple transactions](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/create-simple-transaction/)\n*   [Native assets](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/native-tokens/)\n*   [Cardano governance update proposals](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-wiki/blob/main/docs/reference/cardano-governance.md)\n*   [Creating Cardano testnets](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-wiki/blob/main/docs/reference/create-cardano.md)\n\n**Plutus scripts**\n\n*   [About Plutus scripts](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-wiki/blob/main/docs/reference/plutus/babbage-script-example.md) (Plutus V2 examples)\n*   [Plutus spending script](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-wiki/blob/main/docs/reference/plutus/plutus-spending-script-example.md)\n*   [Babbage certifying script example](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-wiki/blob/main/docs/reference/plutus/babbage-certifying-script-example.md)\n*   [Babbage withdrawing script example](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-wiki/blob/main/docs/reference/plutus/babbage-withdrawing-script-example.md)\n\n> Note: For more information about Plutus, tutorials, and how-to guides go to [Plinth user guide](https://plutus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n**Vasil tutorials**\n\nThe tutorials below provide explainers of the CIPs introduced with Vasil functionality.
