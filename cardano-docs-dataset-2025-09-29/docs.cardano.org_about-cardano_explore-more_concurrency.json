In Cardano's Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTXO) model, transactions can be processed in parallel, enabling multiple operations without causing system failures. This approach enhances system throughput while maintaining the performance of individual operations.\n\nThe EUTXO model, employed by Cardano, allows for secure and predictable execution of smart contracts. By splitting logic across different branches and utilizing multiple UTXOs, Cardano achieves greater parallelism, leading to improved scalability.\n\nThe level of concurrency sets the limit for simultaneous operations. Developers should adopt strategies to minimize contention and translate concurrency into parallelism, which may involve a learning curve but yields significant benefits.\n\nLearn more:\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project. Cardano is a software platform ONLY and does not conduct any independent diligence on, or substantive review of, any blockchain asset, digital currency, cryptocurrency or associated funds. You are fully and solely responsible for evaluating your investments, for determining whether you will exchange blockchain assets based on your own judgement, and for all your decisions as to whether to exchange blockchain assets with Cardano. In many cases, blockchain assets you exchange on the basis of your research may not increase in value, and may decrease in value. Similarly, blockchain assets you exchange on the basis of your research may fall or rise in value after your exchange. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Any investment in blockchain assets involves the risk of loss of part or all of your investment. The value of the blockchain assets you exchange is subject to market and other investment risks.\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY 4.0\n\nÂ© IOHK 2015-2025 - IOHK Supported Project",
