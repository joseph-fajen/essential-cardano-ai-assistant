The\nsize of the stake is proportional to the amount of ada held. Users who hold a\nstake in Cardano can get passive rewards for validating blocks.\n\nSince not everyone has the time, knowledge, or resources to run a stake pool,\nada holders can delegate their stake to a preferred pool and let an operator\nmaintain their stake on their behalf. This allows everyone to participate in the\nconsensus and get rewards without having to continuously run the node online.\nThe higher the stake in a pool, the more rewards will be assigned to its\nowners.\n\nNote that you can spend your ada at any time, regardless of how you delegated it.\n\nAda holders can delegate their stake using different ecosystem wallets that support this functionality. Here are\nsome useful articles to review:\n\nIf you'd like to include additional references to delegation tutorials, please submit a pull request.\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project.
