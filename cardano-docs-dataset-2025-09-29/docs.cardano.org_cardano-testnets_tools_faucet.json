While these tokens have no 'real world' value, they enable users to\nexperiment with Cardano testnet features, without having to spend real ada on\nthe mainnet.\n\n### To request tokens using the faucet:[​](#to-request-tokens-using-the-faucet \"Direct link to To request tokens using the faucet:\")\n\n`pool18ttg8k...a1c`\n\n### Delegation[​](#delegation \"Direct link to Delegation\")\n\nIf you're an SPO and wish to test stake pool operations on preview or\npre-production testnets, you can request some test ada to be delegated to your\npool. For this, choose the environment you're working in, and select 'receive\npool delegation' from the action menu.\n\nWhen you have finished using your test tokens, please return them to the faucet\nso that other members of the community can use them. You can return your test\ntokens to the relevant address:\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project.
