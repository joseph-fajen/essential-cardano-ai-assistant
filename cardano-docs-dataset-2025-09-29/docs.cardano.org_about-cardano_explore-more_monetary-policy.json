With Voltaire, the treasury performs this\nfunction, and funding for new features, improvements, etc. is allocated\nthrough a decentralized voting system.\n\n## Stake pools[​](#stake-pools \"Direct link to Stake pools\")\n\nThe principles of decentralization and fairness drive Cardano's development.\nCardano offers equal opportunities to anyone who wishes to become part\nof the network by running a stake pool. But the very freedom to participate\nopens up the possibility of unfair advantage posed by larger stake pool\noperators. This presents the challenge of maintaining the integrity of the chain\nwhile incentivizing people to create pools and support the chain.\n\n## Incentives mechanism[​](#incentives-mechanism \"Direct link to Incentives mechanism\")\n\nCardano's monetary expansion relies on a long-term commitment by stake pool\noperators to provide ongoing support for the chain. This commitment requires a\nsolid and stable incentivization mechanism for the operators, so this mechanism\nmust ensure that the incentive system does not significantly change in time in a\nway that might adversely affect the operators’ income.\n\nCardano's incentive system for stake pool operators is designed to balance k\nfully saturated pools (where k is the number of desired pools), so this\nequilibrium means that rewards will be optimal for everybody when all stake is\ndelegated uniformly to the k most attractive pools.\n\n## Monetary policy[​](#monetary-policy \"Direct link to Monetary policy\")\n\nCardano's monetary policy addresses two issues:\n\n* the necessity to offer rewards for people who participate in the network\n* funding the treasury.\n\n**Rewards**\n\nThe expansion and future improvement of the Cardano blockchain will be greatly\ninfluenced by its community, who need to be incentivized through rewards to\nparticipate in Cardano’s development.\n\nStaking rewards for delegators and stake pool operators come from two sources:\n\n* Transaction fees - fees from every transaction from all blocks produced during\n  every epoch go into a virtual 'pot'. A fixed percentage (ρ) of the remaining\n  ada reserves is added to that pot.\n* Monetary expansion - a certain percentage (τ) of the pot is sent to the\n  treasury, and the rest is used as epoch rewards.\n\nThis system is designed to ensure that the portion of rewards taken from the\nreserves is high at the beginning when transaction numbers are still relatively\nlow. This incentivizes early adopters to move quickly to benefit from high\ninitial rewards. Over time, and as the number of transactions increases,\nadditional fees will compensate for smaller reserves.\n\nThis mechanism also ensures that available rewards are predictable and do not\nvary dramatically. Instead, rewards change gradually. The fixed percentage taken\nfrom remaining reserves every epoch guarantees a smooth exponential decline.\n\n**Funding the treasury**\n\nThe treasury's goal is the provision of funds to develop Cardano activities\nthrough a voting process. This necessitates a process whereby funds are\nregularly sent to the treasury to ensure that funds are always available.\n\n## Policy rationale for the ρ and τ values[​](#policy-rationale-for-the-ρ-and-τ-values \"Direct link to Policy rationale for the ρ and τ values\")\n\nA lot of thought was put into determining what the values for ρ (fixed\npercentage) and τ (funds going into the treasury) should be.\n\n**Calculating ρ**\n\nWhile searching for the right ρ value, the team faced a quandary: A higher value would mean higher rewards for everybody initially, and the treasury would fill faster. But higher values of ρ would also mean that the reserves would deplete faster. Paying high rewards and incentivizing early adopters is a crucial consideration, but so is to offer a long-term perspective for all stakeholders. Therefore, the solution to this quandary requires a tradeoff between these two issues.\n\nAdopting an exponential decay approach to prevent Cardano’s reserve from running out makes sense in this situation.\n\nCalculating the 'reserve half life' (that is, the time that it takes for half of the reserve to be used up) visualizes the impact of choosing a specific value of ρ over another. This was the subject of much discussion, and eventually, the value assigned was 0.3%. The reason why is that mathematical projections showed that a ρ (the fixed percentage of ada going into the virtual pot every epoch) value of 0.3% would mean a reserve half-life of four to five years. In simple terms, just half of the remaining reserve would be used every four to five years.\n\n**Choosing τ**\n\nDetermining the right value for τ (the percentage of unclaimed rewards\nautomatically going to the reserves every epoch) was equally challenging.\nFollowing discussions, deliberations, and projections, the τ value was set at a fixed rate of 20%.\n\nThis rate applies to both the per-epoch monetary expansion and the fees that the blockchain charges for each transaction. The treasury amount is deducted before any other rewards are allocated. The remaining per-epoch monetary expansion and fees may be allocated to stake pools based on the provided formula.\n\nIt is important to note that the rewards given to stake pools may be reduced under certain conditions, such as when pools are not saturated, not fully pledged, or fail to produce their allocated blocks. Any unclaimed rewards remain in the reserves for future allocation. This explains the slightly varying difference in the percentage of treasury allocations.\n\nOn this page\n\n* [Stake pools](#stake-pools)\n* [Incentives mechanism](#incentives-mechanism)\n* [Monetary policy](#monetary-policy)\n* [Policy rationale for the ρ and τ values](#policy-rationale-for-the-ρ-and-τ-values)",
