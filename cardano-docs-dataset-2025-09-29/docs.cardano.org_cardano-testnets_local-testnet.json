While preview and pre-production environments benefit the wider developer community, a local testnet allows the execution of a hard fork in your own setup and subsequent testing of DApp behavior.\n\nThere are several possible solutions to create a local testnet. These include the use of Plutip (a tool for private network creation) or Nix (a tool for package management and system configuration).\n\n## Creating a local testnet using Plutip[​](#creating-a-local-testnet-using-plutip \"Direct link to Creating a local testnet using Plutip\")\n\n[Plutip](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/plutip), a tool developed on the Cardano blockchain, facilitates the creation of a private network to run Plutus contracts on.\n\nPlutip can be used in two different ways:\n\n*Tutorials referenced above are created by the MLabs team.*\n\n## Creating a local testnet using Nix[​](#creating-a-local-testnet-using-nix \"Direct link to Creating a local testnet using Nix\")\n\nAnother possible option is to spin up a local testnet using Nix. For more information, learn about the [packaging principles](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-world/blob/master/docs/explain/packaging-principles.md), and see how to [create a local testnet using Nix](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-world/blob/master/docs/explain/create-testnet.md).\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project. Cardano is a software platform ONLY and does not conduct any independent diligence on, or substantive review of, any blockchain asset, digital currency, cryptocurrency or associated funds. You are fully and solely responsible for evaluating your investments, for determining whether you will exchange blockchain assets based on your own judgement, and for all your decisions as to whether to exchange blockchain assets with Cardano. In many cases, blockchain assets you exchange on the basis of your research may not increase in value, and may decrease in value. Similarly, blockchain assets you exchange on the basis of your research may fall or rise in value after your exchange. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Any investment in blockchain assets involves the risk of loss of part or all of your investment. The value of the blockchain assets you exchange is subject to market and other investment risks.\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY 4.0\n\n© IOHK 2015-2025 - IOHK Supported Project",
