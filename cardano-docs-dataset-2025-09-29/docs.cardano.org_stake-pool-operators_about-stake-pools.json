Stake\npools use the [Cardano node](https://docs.cardano.org/learn/cardano-node/) to\nform the backbone of the Cardano network by processing transactions and\nvalidating and producing blocks.\n\nStake pool roles include a stake pool operator and one or more stake pool\nowner(s). It is important to note the conceptual differences between the two:\n\nUsually, the stake pool operator and the owner are the same person. However, a\nstake pool can have multiple owners that choose to combine their pledge. It\nshould be noted that the stake pool's declared pledge must be met by the\ncombined stake in the owner's wallets and failure to do so will result in the\npool being unable to produce blocks.\n\nAll operator and owner rewards are paid out into a single rewards account\nassociated with the reward address of the pool. If a stake pool has multiple\nowners, it is up to the owner of the rewards account to distribute rewards to\nthe operator and other owners.\n\nAn agreement is likely needed to define when and how the accumulated rewards in\na shared account should be split. For example, they can agree to have the\noperator control the shared account, or they can choose to use a multisig\naccount.\n\nTo run a pool effectively, a bi-directional relationship and trust are crucial.\nIf this trust is broken, other parties can lose in regards to accumulated or\npotential rewards, or reputation for the operator.\n\nDeveloper resources:\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project.
