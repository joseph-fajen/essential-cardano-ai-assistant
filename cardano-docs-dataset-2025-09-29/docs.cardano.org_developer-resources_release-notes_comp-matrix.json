(It does not reflect any stacks.) The compatibility matrix should be read in conjunction with the Cardano component dependencies definition.\n\nIf you only require using the node, such as interacting directly with the node or managing stake pool operations, we recommend the latest node version. If you need compatibility with all components, we recommend using version 10.1.4.\n\n| [Cardano node](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/releases) | [Cardano DB

operations. It details essential and optional tools for tasks such as stake pool operations, transaction management, and data handling.\n\n| Stack | Core components | Description | Optional components |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Stake pool operations | `cardano-node``cardano-cli` | Essential for block creation and participating in the consensus process. `cardano-cli` provides command-line interface for managing and interacting with the node. | Monitoring tools like `Prometheus` and `Grafana` for performance metrics. |\n| Address management | `cardano-addresses``cardano-cli` | `cardano-addresses` is used for creating and managing cryptographic addresses. It's often bundled with `cardano-node` for ease of use in address operations. |  |\n| Handling wallets and transactions | `cardano-rosetta``cardano-wallet` | `cardano-wallet` is used for direct wallet management and transactions. `cardano-rosetta` offers a standardized interface for interacting with the blockchain. |  |\n| On-chain data and metadata | `cardano-db-sync``cardano-graphql` | `cardano-db-sync` populates a PostgreSQL database from node data, making it queryable. `cardano-graphql` allows querying this data via GraphQL. | `cardano-rosetta` can be used for blockchain agnostic data interaction. |\n\n[Previous Release notes](https://docs.cardano.org/developer-resources/release-notes/release-notes)\n\n![Image 2: Cardano Logo](https://docs.cardano.org/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n\nMore About Cardano\n\n*   [Cardano Explorer](https://cardanoexplorer.com/)\n*   [Cardano Foundation](https://cardanofoundation.org/)\n*   [Cardano.org](https://www.cardano.org/)\n*   [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/)\n\nJoin the community\n\n*   [Cardano Community](https://cardano.org/)\n*   [Cardano Telegram](https://t.me/CardanoAnnouncements/)\n*   [Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/)\n*   [Cardano Blog](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/)\n*   [IOHK](https://www.iohk.io/)\n*   [IOHK blog](https://www.iohk.io/blog/)\n*   [IOHK YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBJ0p9aCW-W82TwNM-z3V2w)\n*   [Cardano Foundation YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbQ9vGfezru1YRI1zDCtTGg)\n*   [Cardano Foundation Twitter](https://twitter.com/Cardano_CF)\n*   [IOG Academy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX9j__vYOJu00iqBrCzecVw)\n\nFollow us\n\n*   [X](https://twitter.com/inputoutputHK)\n*   [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/iohk.io/)\n*   [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/IohkIo)\n*   [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/)\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nEmail* \n\n*   - [x] By checking this box, I agree to allow IOG to store and process the personal data submitted on this form in accordance with the IOG [Privacy Policy](https://static.iohk.io/terms/iog-privacy-policy.pdf)* \n\nCardano is an open-source project. Cardano is a software platform ONLY and does not conduct any independent diligence on, or substantive review of, any blockchain asset, digital currency, cryptocurrency or associated funds. You are fully and solely responsible for evaluating your investments, for determining whether you will exchange blockchain assets based on your own judgement, and for all your decisions as to whether to exchange blockchain assets with Cardano. In many cases, blockchain assets you exchange on the basis of your research may not increase in value, and may decrease in value. Similarly, blockchain assets you exchange on the basis of your research may fall or rise in value after your exchange. Past performance is not indicative of future results.
