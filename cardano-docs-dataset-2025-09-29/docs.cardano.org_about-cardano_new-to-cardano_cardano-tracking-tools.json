These explorers provide user-oriented tools that\nfetch data from the main database and reflect it in a straightforward and\nconvenient web interface.\n\nExplorers usually show epoch details, which include:\n\nBy choosing a specific block, you can explore it in more detail to see its ID,\nsize, epoch and block details, number of included transactions, and\nconfirmations.\n\nYou can also search for specific epochs, transactions, or blocks by pasting their\nIDs in the search field.\n\n## Exploring assets[​](#exploring-assets \"Direct link to Exploring assets\")\n\nCardano supports multi-asset creation and management. To see a list of created\nassets and tokens, you can use these tools:\n\n## Exploring stake pools[​](#exploring-stake-pools \"Direct link to Exploring stake pools\")\n\nTo find a list of all registered stake pools, their tickers, pool names, and\nIDs, you can use these tools:\n\nIf you'd like to include additional references to ecosystem tracking tools, please submit a pull request.\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project. Cardano is a software platform ONLY and does not conduct any independent diligence on, or substantive review of, any blockchain asset, digital currency, cryptocurrency or associated funds. You are fully and solely responsible for evaluating your investments, for determining whether you will exchange blockchain assets based on your own judgement, and for all your decisions as to whether to exchange blockchain assets with Cardano. In many cases, blockchain assets you exchange on the basis of your research may not increase in value, and may decrease in value. Similarly, blockchain assets you exchange on the basis of your research may fall or rise in value after your exchange. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Any investment in blockchain assets involves the risk of loss of part or all of your investment. The value of the blockchain assets you exchange is subject to market and other investment risks.\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY 4.0\n\n© IOHK 2015-2025 - IOHK Supported Project",
