First, you need to ensure that you already have rewards available in your stake address. Check it with the following command:\n\n`cardano-cli`\n`$ cardano-cli query stake-address-info --address $(cat stake.addr)  \n[  \n {  \n \"address\": \"stake_test1uq954t492tmusk2dy9z505g3cz3sfpnh0swsqjmzk47rasqyn8uqp\",  \n \"delegation\": \"pool18pn6p9ef58u4ga3wagp44qhzm8f6zncl57g6qgh0pk3yytwz54h\",  \n \"rewardAccountBalance\": 29385845  \n }  \n]`\n\nIn this case, you have ~29 ada. You also need some of your own ada to pay the fees, so you need to query your payment address:\n\n`$ cardano-cli query utxo --address $(cat payment.addr)  \n TxHash TxIx Amount  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nafb33e353a9880b7cbd9e5eb2cbffa024d1b3b938ee2c739e53dd187094e8f0d 0 10000000 lovelace + TxOutDatumInline ReferenceTxInsScriptsInlineDatumsInBabbageEra (HashableScriptData \"\\216y\\159\\CAN*\\255\" (ScriptDataConstructor 0 [ScriptDataNumber 42]))  \nafb33e353a9880b7cbd9e5eb2cbffa024d1b3b938ee2c739e53dd187094e8f0d 1 9987657206 lovelace + TxOutDatumNone`\n\nUse the second UTXO with TxIx=1. You're ready to create your withdrawal transaction:\n\n`cardano-cli transaction build \\  \n --tx-in afb33e353a9880b7cbd9e5eb2cbffa024d1b3b938ee2c739e53dd187094e8f0d#1 \\  \n --withdrawal $(cat stake.addr)+29385845 \\  \n --change-address $(cat payment.addr) \\  \n --out-file withdrawal-tx.raw`\n\nNote that this transaction will take funds from the stake address, so it will need to be signed with the `stake.skey` file:\n\n`stake.skey`\n`cardano-cli transaction sign \\  \n --tx-file withdrawal-tx.raw \\  \n --signing-key-file payment.skey \\  \n --signing-key-file stake.skey \\  \n --out-file withdrawal-tx.signed  \n  \ncardano-cli transaction submit --tx-file withdrawal-tx.signed`\n\nFinally, verify that you have received your rewards in your payment address:\n\n`$ cardano-cli query utxo --address $(cat payment.addr)  \n TxHash TxIx Amount  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n2b1bfc342c1f5531df4cfa220eac79574142c7263d97885d2ad8588ca1a7e22b 0 10016871698 lovelace + TxOutDatumNone  \nafb33e353a9880b7cbd9e5eb2cbffa024d1b3b938ee2c739e53dd187094e8f0d 0 10000000 lovelace + TxOutDatumInline ReferenceTxInsScriptsInlineDatumsInBabbageEra (HashableScriptData \"\\216y\\159\\CAN*\\255\" (ScriptDataConstructor 0 [ScriptDataNumber 42]))`\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project.
