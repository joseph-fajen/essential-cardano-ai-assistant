Preview is meant for DApps, stake pool operators (SPOs), and\nexchanges who wish to test mature release candidates.\n\n## Late-stage testing networks[​](#late-stage-testing-networks \"Direct link to Late-stage testing networks\")\n\n### Pre-production[​](#pre-production \"Direct link to Pre-production\")\n\nPre-production is the most mature network for testing purposes, which resembles\na production (mainnet) environment. It is meant for exchanges, SPOs,\npre-deployment DApps, and wallets that wish to test release functionality before\ndeploying on mainnet.\n\n### Production network (mainnet)[​](#production-network-mainnet \"Direct link to Production network (mainnet)\")\n\nProduction is the live network, also referred to as mainnet. It features\nofficial functionality releases. Exchanges, SPOs, DApps, wallets, and end users\ncan use the mainnet for development, transaction processing, and other needs.\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project. Cardano is a software platform ONLY and does not conduct any independent diligence on, or substantive review of, any blockchain asset, digital currency, cryptocurrency or associated funds. You are fully and solely responsible for evaluating your investments, for determining whether you will exchange blockchain assets based on your own judgement, and for all your decisions as to whether to exchange blockchain assets with Cardano. In many cases, blockchain assets you exchange on the basis of your research may not increase in value, and may decrease in value. Similarly, blockchain assets you exchange on the basis of your research may fall or rise in value after your exchange. Past performance is not indicative of future results.
