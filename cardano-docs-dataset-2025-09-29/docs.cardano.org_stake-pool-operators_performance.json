If the stake pool does not produce a block, the slot\nwill remain empty and the blockchain will *not* be extended. The Cardano\nblockchain can tolerate a number of missing blocks, but the majority of blocks\nexpected to be produced (at least 50% + 1) must be generated during an epoch.\n\nAlthough occasionally missed blocks don’t affect the extension of the blockchain\nas a whole, an unresponsive elected stake pool decreases the overall performance\nof the network, which is undesirable.\n\nStake pool performance is calculated according to its expected activity as the\nratio of a number of blocks a stake pool produces in a given epoch versus the\nnumber it was capable to produce. For instance, if the stake pool could produce\n100 blocks (based on its stake and the chance to be elected) in an epoch, but it\nactually produced just 50 blocks, its performance would be 50%.\n\nPoor stake pool performance decreases the number of rewards that a pool and its\nmembers receive, thereby decreasing its attractiveness to delegators. To improve\nits performance, a stake pool should have good network connectivity, be run on a\nreliable system, and actively participate in block production and verification.\n\nThe higher the pool’s performance, the more attractive it will be to delegators\nsince it will offer higher rewards and incentives.\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project.
