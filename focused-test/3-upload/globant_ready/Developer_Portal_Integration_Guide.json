You can use it to send and receive payments on the Cardano blockchain via a http and cli interface.\n- [cardano-db-sync](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-db-sync) follows the Cardano chain and takes information from the chain and an internally maintained copy of ledger state. Data is then extracted from the chain and inserted into a PostgreSQL database.\n- [cardano-graphql](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-graphql) a cross-platform, typed, and queryable API for Cardano.\n- [cardano-rosetta](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-rosetta-java) a multi-platform implementation of [Rosetta](https://www.rosetta-api.org/) for Cardano, targeting the version defined in the [API docs](https://cardano-foundation.github.io/cardano-rosetta-java/api).\n- [cardano-addresses](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-addresses) provides mnemonic (backup phrase) creation, and conversion of a mnemonic to seed for wallet restoration, and address derivation functionalities.\n\n## Tutorials [​](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/integrate-cardano/\\#tutorials \"Direct link to Tutorials\")\n\n- [Explore Cardano wallets](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/integrate-cardano/creating-wallet-faucet) \\- learn how to create a Cardano wallet, receive test ada and create basic transactions.\n- [Multi-witness transactions](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/integrate-cardano/multi-witness-transactions-cli) \\- learn how to create transactions with multiple inputs and one output.\n- [Listening for ada payments using cardano-cli](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/integrate-cardano/listening-for-payments-cli) \\- how to listen to a specific address using cardano-cli.\n- [Listening for ada payments using cardano-wallet](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/integrate-cardano/listening-for-payments-wallet) \\- how to listen to a specific address using cardano-wallet.\n- [Testnet Faucet](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/integrate-cardano/testnet-faucet) \\- a service that provides test ada (tAda) to users of the Cardano testnets.\n- [Sample queries](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402395914009-Sample-cardano-rosetta-queries) for cardano-rosetta.\n- [Sample queries](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900000906566-Sample-cardano-graphql-queries) for cardano-graphql.\n\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/developer-portal/edit/staging/docs/integrate-cardano/overview.md)\n\nLast updated on **Jul 31, 2025** by **bora**\n\n[Previous\\\\\n\\\\\nDeveloper Community](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/cardano-developer-community) [Next\\\\\n\\\\\nExploring Cardano wallets](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/integrate-cardano/creating-wallet-faucet)\n\nDeveloper Portal\n\nDeveloper Community\n\nMore about Cardano\n\n[Terms](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/terms-and-conditions) \\| [Privacy Policy](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/privacy)",
