    "introduction": "A blockchain is a type of database or ledger that is duplicated and distributed\nto all participants within the blockchain network. It is made up of a set of\ninterconnected nodes that store data or items of value in blocks. These blocks\nare validated, cryptograhpically secured, and linked to each other in\nchronological order in a chain. The information stored in the validated blocks\nof the blockchain cannot be altered later on. It is permanently inscribed in the\ndistributed ledger.\nBlockchain technology, otherwise known as distributed ledger technology (DLT),\nprovides a decentralized and accessible data structure for various records. Such\nrecords might include financial payment and transaction details, as well as\nother types of information – from commerce to internet of things (IoT) records.\nAs a blockchain stores data in a decentralized manner, it is independent of\ncentralized, controlling entities, or middlemen. This provides enhanced\ntransparency of data storage and its management. An important feature of\nblockchain is that it stores records immutably, which means that they cannot be\nchanged, forged, or deleted, as this will break the chain of records.\nBlockchain can be compared to a book of permanent records, where every page acts\nas an information holder:\n![chain-of-blocks](https://docs.cardano.org/assets/images/chain-of-blocks-cc81268ae211fa0d21acffddaec12bba.png)\nLet’s take a closer look at existing data storage solutions to understand the\ndifference between these systems:\n![data-storage](https://ucarecdn.com/af01444d-6881-4aab-a0a9-ec2ff6a0ea40/)\n- **Centralized systems** — all data entries and activities are usually managed\nusing one central server.
