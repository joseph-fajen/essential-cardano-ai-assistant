# Essential Cardano AI Assistant Project

A sophisticated AI assistant chatbot for the Essential Cardano community, built on the Globant Enterprise platform. This assistant serves as a knowledgeable guide for the Cardano ecosystem, helping users navigate from basic concepts to advanced topics across governance, technical documentation, and community resources.

## Project Overview

### Mission
Create an educational, community-focused AI assistant that provides accurate, well-sourced information about Cardano blockchain, its ecosystem, governance, and related topics while maintaining strict quality and safety standards.

### Target Audiences
- **General Users**: New to blockchain, need basic explanations and onboarding guidance
- **Tech-Savvy Users**: Familiar with blockchain, interested in governance participation and advanced features  
- **Developers**: Need technical documentation (redirected to appropriate resources)
- **Stake Pool Operators**: Infrastructure operators requiring technical and governance information

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Comprehensive system prompt development (`system_prompt.md`)
- [x] URL reference guide for accurate source citations (`url_reference_guide.md`)
- [x] Multi-source knowledge base architecture strategy (`knowledge_base_architecture.md`)
- [x] Globant Enterprise platform implementation strategy (`globant_platform_strategy.md`)
- [x] Content ingestion and management workflows (`content_ingestion_workflow.md`)
- [x] Essential Cardano content upload (~1,000 files) to Globant Enterprise
- [x] Comprehensive workflow commands (`.claude/commands/`)

### üöß In Progress
