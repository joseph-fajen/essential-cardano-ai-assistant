Important properties of such systems are frequently proved on the specification level, but implementations typically deviate from specifications for practical reasons. Machine-checked proofs of bisimilarity statements are often useful for guaranteeing that properties of specifications carry over to implementations. In this paper, we present a way of conducting such proofs with a focus on network communication. The proofs resulting from our approach are not just machine-checked but also intelligible for humans.\n\nView full paper\n\n![IOHK logo black and white](https://ucarecdn.com/306dc384-d0ae-479a-9b7e-2814fbeaea9b/-/resize/200/)\n\n##### Products\n\n##### Media\n\n##### Courses\n\n##### Legal\n\n##### Social",
