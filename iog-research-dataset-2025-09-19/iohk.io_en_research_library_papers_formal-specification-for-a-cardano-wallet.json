The purpose of this document is to help understand some of the subtleties and give a reasonable starting point for tests and implementations.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, no other existing cryptocurrency wallet comes with such a formal specification.\n\nWe have therefore attempted to formalise the core functionality of the existing wallet and let our knowledge of the difficulties with the current implementation be a guide in deciding which aspects of the wallet needed more careful thought. We also state and (partially) prove various properties of the wallet models we develop, not only to prove its correctness but also to try and capture our intuitions about what a cryptocurrency wallet is, exactly.\n\nView full paper\n\n![IOHK logo black and white](https://ucarecdn.com/306dc384-d0ae-479a-9b7e-2814fbeaea9b/-/resize/200/)\n\n##### Products\n\n##### Media\n\n##### Courses\n\n##### Legal\n\n##### Social",
