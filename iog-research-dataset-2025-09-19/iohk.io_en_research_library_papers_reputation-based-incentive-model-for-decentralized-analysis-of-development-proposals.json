Firstly, we consider how the rewards of Proposal Assessors (who write assessments on proposals) and Veteran Proposal Assessors (who rank assessments) depend on the different types of work theyâ€™ve done. Then, we consider the definition and properties of the reputation function and present a rationale for selecting coefficients for different types of work.\n\nView full paper\n\n![IOHK logo black and white](https://ucarecdn.com/306dc384-d0ae-479a-9b7e-2814fbeaea9b/-/resize/200/)\n\n##### Products\n\n##### Media\n\n##### Courses\n\n##### Legal\n\n##### Social",
