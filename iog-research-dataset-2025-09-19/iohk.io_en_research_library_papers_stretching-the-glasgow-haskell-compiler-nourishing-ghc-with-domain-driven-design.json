However, the literature on architecting such systems with a pure functional language is scarce. In this paper we contribute to that discourse, by using a large-scale system: the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), as a guide to more maintainable, flexible and effective, pure functional architectures. We describe, from experience, how GHC as a system, violates the desirable properties that make pure functional programming attractive: immutability, modularity, and composability. With these violations identified, we provide guidance for other functional system architectures; drawing heavily on Domain-Driven Design. We write from an engineering perspective, with the hope that our experience may provide insight into best practices for other pure functional software architects.\n\nView full paper\n\n![IOHK logo black and white](https://ucarecdn.com/306dc384-d0ae-479a-9b7e-2814fbeaea9b/-/resize/200/)\n\n##### Products\n\n##### Media\n\n##### Courses\n\n##### Legal\n\n##### Social",
