In compare with simplified models of PoS consensus, considered before in [2], we investigate two models (named Model 1 and Model 2), taking into account all features of Ouroboros Praos protocol [1]: slot creation function, active slot coefficient, possibility of empty slots and slots with multiple slot leaders (both honest and malicious), non-linear dependence between stake ratio and probability to become slot leader in some timeslot, end even non-zero synchronization time (for Model 2), measured in timeslots. In Model 1 (with zero synchronization time), we obtain explicit formulas for the exact double spend attack probability value. In Model 2 (with non-zero synchronization time), we have to make some simplification assumption in favor of the adversary. As a result, we get an upper probability estimation, using so-called dominated distribution.\n\nView full paper\n\n![IOHK logo black and white](https://ucarecdn.com/306dc384-d0ae-479a-9b7e-2814fbeaea9b/-/resize/200/)\n\n##### Products\n\n##### Media\n\n##### Courses\n\n##### Legal\n\n##### Social",
