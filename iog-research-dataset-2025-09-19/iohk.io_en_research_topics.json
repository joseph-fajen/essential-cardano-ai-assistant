Projects in various areas and topics that develop a DApp on the Cardano platform are welcome. A good entry point for DApp developers is the [Plutus Pioneer Program](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program).\n\n![](/cardano-logo.svg)\n\n### A PoS blockchain protocol stack\n\nA wide array of topics are relevant, such as PoS consensus layer and its scalability, robust networking, sidechain design and cross-chain interoperability, rewards distribution, governance.\n\n![](/identus-logo.svg)\n\n### A self-sovereign identity platform\n\nTopics related to identity management including privacy enhancements or use-cases that exploit decentralized identity.\n\n![](/hydra-logo.svg)\n\n### A suite of layer-2 protocols\n\nPotential topics of interest include exploring tradeoffs between criteria such as optimistic and worst-case settlement latency, full smart-contract compatibility, fluctuating-availability tolerance, main-chain footprint.\n\n![](/plutus-logo.svg)\n\n### A functional smart-contract language\n\nTopics of interest include improving the development toolset for Plutus and smart-contract writing in general. Developer resources: [Plutus Core Github repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus).\n\n![](/marlowe-pioneers-logo.svg)\n\n### A finance-focused domain specific language\n\nDevelopment of other DSLs for specific domains with interest in design decentralized applications.\n\n![](/daedalus-logo.svg)\n\n### A full-node wallet\n\nTopics of interest include key management and wallet security, wallet-to-wallet communication.\n\n![](/lace-logo.svg)\n\n### A light wallet\n\nTopics of interest include wallet security, integration between wallet back ends and applications, key management.\n\n![](/catalyst-logo.svg)\n\n### A stakeholder-managed treasury for project funding\n\nSome examples of topics include participatory budgeting, incentives for management of blockchain treasuries.\n\n![IOHK logo black and white](https://ucarecdn.com/306dc384-d0ae-479a-9b7e-2814fbeaea9b/-/resize/200/)\n\n##### Products\n\n##### Media\n\n##### Courses\n\n##### Legal\n\n##### Social",
