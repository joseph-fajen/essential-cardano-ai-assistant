It supports smart contracts through Plutus, a language based on System Fùúî with recursion. About half a dozen languages compile into Plutus, the first of which is Plinth (formerly Plutus Tx) ‚Äî a language that reuses a subset of the Haskell syntax, and has been in commercial use since 2021.\n\nOur journey building Plinth has been unconventional in a number of ways. First, Plinth programs are written in a subset of Haskell, using standard Haskell syntax and types, which brings a number of advantages. Second, compilation is primarily handled by a GHC plugin, one of the most intricate we are aware of. Third, while some compiler optimizations mirror those in Haskell, others diverge significantly to meet on-chain execution constraints. Fourth, Plutus programs run on an instrumented CEK machine with a formal specification in Agda. This report reflects on our design choices, outlining effective practices, challenges, and key takeaways, with an emphasis on recent advances in the language, compiler, and runtime.\n\nView full paper\n\n![IOHK logo black and white](https://ucarecdn.com/306dc384-d0ae-479a-9b7e-2814fbeaea9b/-/resize/200/)\n\n##### Products\n\n##### Media\n\n##### Courses\n\n##### Legal\n\n##### Social",
