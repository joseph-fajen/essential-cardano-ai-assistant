This paper extends the Agda ecosystem into machine learning territory, and, vice versa, makes Agda related resources available to machine learning practitioners. We introduce and release a novel dataset of Agda program-proofs that is elaborate and extensive enough to support various machine learning applications – the first of its kind. Leveraging the dataset’s ultra-high resolution, which details proof states at the sub-type level, we propose a novel neural architecture targeted at faithfully representing dependently-typed programs on the basis of structural rather than nominal principles. We instantiate and evaluate our architecture in a premise selection setup, where it achieves promising initial results, surpassing strong baselines.\n\nView full paper\n\n![IOHK logo black and white](https://ucarecdn.com/306dc384-d0ae-479a-9b7e-2814fbeaea9b/-/resize/200/)\n\n##### Products\n\n##### Media\n\n##### Courses\n\n##### Legal\n\n##### Social",
