Our construction leverages on timed primitives. Namely, we introduce a novel Delta-delay hash function definition in order to establish turns in the channel. Concretely, we introduce the one-way turn-based communication scheme and the two-way turn-based communication protocol and provide a concrete instantiation that achieves communication consistency.\n\nView full paper\n\n![IOHK logo black and white](https://ucarecdn.com/306dc384-d0ae-479a-9b7e-2814fbeaea9b/-/resize/200/)\n\n##### Products\n\n##### Media\n\n##### Courses\n\n##### Legal\n\n##### Social",
