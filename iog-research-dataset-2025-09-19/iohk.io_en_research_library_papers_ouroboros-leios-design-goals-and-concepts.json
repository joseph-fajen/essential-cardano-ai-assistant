They are not primarily limited by the resources available to each node (network capacity or CPU performance), but by the nature of the data dependencies and communication dependencies within the distributed algorithm. Improving this requires a new algorithm design – which is what Ouroboros Leios is intended to be.\n\nIn addition, a new design provides an opportunity to incorporate other useful modern features: tiered transaction fees with corresponding levels of service priority, and faster chain synchronisation by removing the need to execute every smart contract.\n\nThere are of course trade-offs in the design, in particular increased resource use and increased transaction latency, and these are discussed.\n\nThe new Ouroboros Leios design is not a small or modular extension however. It is a substantial extension of the Ouroboros Praos and Genesis designs, and the changes to a practical implementation will also be substantial.\n\nView full paper\n\n![IOHK logo black and white](https://ucarecdn.com/306dc384-d0ae-479a-9b7e-2814fbeaea9b/-/resize/200/)\n\n##### Products\n\n##### Media\n\n##### Courses\n\n##### Legal\n\n##### Social",
