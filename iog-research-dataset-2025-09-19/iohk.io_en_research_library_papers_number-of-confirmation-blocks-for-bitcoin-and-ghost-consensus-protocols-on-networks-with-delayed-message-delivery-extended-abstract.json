Existing papers on transaction confirmation blocks for Bitcoin use implicit assumption of prompt spreading of Bitcoin blocks over the network (that is not always the case for the real world conditions). The newer publications with rigorous analysis and proofs of Bitcoin blockchain properties that take into account network delays provide asymptotic estimates, with no specific numbers for transaction confirmation blocks.\n\nWe propose three methods for determination of required number of confirmation blocks for Bitcoin and GHOST on networks with delayed message delivery with different models that take into account the possibility of faster adversarial node syncronization. For the GHOST we propose the first (to our knowledge) strict theoretical.\n\nView full paper\n\n![IOHK logo black and white](https://ucarecdn.com/306dc384-d0ae-479a-9b7e-2814fbeaea9b/-/resize/200/)\n\n##### Products\n\n##### Media\n\n##### Courses\n\n##### Legal\n\n##### Social",
