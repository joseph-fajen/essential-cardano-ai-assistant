Therefore, pre-deployment verification and validation are critical. In fact, auditing has become mandatory in the pipeline of smart contract development. Auditors usually combine manual inspection with automated tools in their auditing work, looking for issues that may be domain dependent (i.e., pertaining to the correct implementation of requirements—which are often informal, partial, and implicit) or independent (e.g., reentrancy, overflow, etc.). To identify domain dependent issues, it is important to understand the non-trivial behavior of the implementation over sequences of calls made by callees playing different roles in the contract. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines predicate abstraction with modal transition systems to build abstractions that can help auditors in the smart contract validation process. The required inputs are a set of predicates provided as code and, optionally, constraints over smart contract function parameters. The output is a modal transition system that captures the contract’s behavior. We report on a prototype that builds modal abstractions and an evaluation on two established benchmarks where we identified four previously unreported issues.\n\nView full paper\n\n![IOHK logo black and white](https://ucarecdn.com/306dc384-d0ae-479a-9b7e-2814fbeaea9b/-/resize/200/)\n\n##### Products\n\n##### Media\n\n##### Courses\n\n##### Legal\n\n##### Social",
