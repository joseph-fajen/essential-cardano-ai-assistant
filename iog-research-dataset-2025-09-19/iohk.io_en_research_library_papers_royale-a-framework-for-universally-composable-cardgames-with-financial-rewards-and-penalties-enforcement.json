Even though folklore holds that poker protocols can be used to play any card game, this conjecture remains unproven and, in fact, does not hold for a number of protocols (including recent results). We both tackle the problem of constructing protocols for general card games and initiate a treatment of such protocols in the Universal Composability (UC) framework, introducing an ideal functionality that captures general card games constructed from a set of core card operations. Based on this formalism, we introduce Royale, the first universally composable protocol for securely playing general card games with financial rewards/penalties enforcement. We remark that Royale also yields the first universally composable poker protocol. Interestingly, such an instantiation of a poker game based on Royale performs better than most previous works without composability guarantees, which we highlight through a detailed concrete complexity analysis and benchmarks obtained from a prototype implementation.\n\nView full paper\n\n![IOHK logo black and white](https://ucarecdn.com/306dc384-d0ae-479a-9b7e-2814fbeaea9b/-/resize/200/)\n\n##### Products\n\n##### Media\n\n##### Courses\n\n##### Legal\n\n##### Social",
