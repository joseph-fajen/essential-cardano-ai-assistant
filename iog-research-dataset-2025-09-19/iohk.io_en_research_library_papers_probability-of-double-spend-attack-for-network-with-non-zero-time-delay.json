The results show that probability of a double spend attack depends essentially on the block delivery time and intensity of block generation. More precisely, the probability of such attack increases when the product of these two values increases. The analytical results obtained in this paper allow not only to calculate the exact value of attack probability, but also to define the minimal number of confirmation\n\nblocks sufficient to guarantee the security against this attack with an arbitrary preset probability value\n\nView full paper\n\n![IOHK logo black and white](https://ucarecdn.com/306dc384-d0ae-479a-9b7e-2814fbeaea9b/-/resize/200/)\n\n##### Products\n\n##### Media\n\n##### Courses\n\n##### Legal\n\n##### Social",
