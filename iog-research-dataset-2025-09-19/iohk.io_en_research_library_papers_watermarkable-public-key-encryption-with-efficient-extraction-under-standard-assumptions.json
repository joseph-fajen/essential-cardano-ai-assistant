Our construction offers constant time extraction complexity with constant size keys and ciphertexts and is secure under standard assumptions, namely the Decisional Composite Residuosity Assumption [Eurocrypt '99] and the Decisional Diffie Hellman in prime order subgroups of square higher order residues.\n\nView full paper\n\n![IOHK logo black and white](https://ucarecdn.com/306dc384-d0ae-479a-9b7e-2814fbeaea9b/-/resize/200/)\n\n##### Products\n\n##### Media\n\n##### Courses\n\n##### Legal\n\n##### Social",
