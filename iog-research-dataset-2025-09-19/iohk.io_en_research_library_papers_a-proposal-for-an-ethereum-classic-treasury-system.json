Anyone can submit a project proposal and the stakeholders will decide on its necessity through a transparent voting procedure. The system is fully verifiable, having no significant influence on ETC performance. The report also takes into account ECIP 1017 that changes Ethereum Classic monetary policy and emission schedule. We expect that the ECTS implementation will increase stability and the outlook of the system, providing additional benefits both for stakeholders and miners from a more stable and predictable system.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxZoSjnHN84\n\nView full paper\n\n![IOHK logo black and white](https://ucarecdn.com/306dc384-d0ae-479a-9b7e-2814fbeaea9b/-/resize/200/)\n\n##### Products\n\n##### Media\n\n##### Courses\n\n##### Legal\n\n##### Social",
