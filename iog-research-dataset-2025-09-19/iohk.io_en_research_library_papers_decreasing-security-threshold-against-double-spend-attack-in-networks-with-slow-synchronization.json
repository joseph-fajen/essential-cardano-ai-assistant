We analyze effect of block generation intensity on the network vulnerability to the attack, and provide analytical expressions for the network security threshold and for the upper bound of block generation intensity.\n\nView full paper\n\n![IOHK logo black and white](https://ucarecdn.com/306dc384-d0ae-479a-9b7e-2814fbeaea9b/-/resize/200/)\n\n##### Products\n\n##### Media\n\n##### Courses\n\n##### Legal\n\n##### Social",
