It is shown\n\nthat even in the best case for the adversary he needs at least around 40% of the whole stake to succeed in this attack. The adversary with a stake\n\nratio about 44% can easily capture half of all blocks in the epoch with probability close to 1.\n\nView full paper\n\n![IOHK logo black and white](https://ucarecdn.com/306dc384-d0ae-479a-9b7e-2814fbeaea9b/-/resize/200/)\n\n##### Products\n\n##### Media\n\n##### Courses\n\n##### Legal\n\n##### Social",
