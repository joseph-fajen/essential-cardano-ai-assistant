We consider Fωµ, which adds higher-order kinds and iso-recursive types. We present the first complete, intrinsically typed, executable, formalisation of System Fωµ that we are aware of. The work is motivated by verifying the core language of a smart contract system based on System Fωµ. The paper is a literate Agda script [14].\n\nView full paper\n\n![IOHK logo black and white](https://ucarecdn.com/306dc384-d0ae-479a-9b7e-2814fbeaea9b/-/resize/200/)\n\n##### Products\n\n##### Media\n\n##### Courses\n\n##### Legal\n\n##### Social",
