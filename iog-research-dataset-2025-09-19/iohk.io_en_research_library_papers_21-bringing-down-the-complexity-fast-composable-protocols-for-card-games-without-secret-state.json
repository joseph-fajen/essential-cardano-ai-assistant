This scenario poses many interesting technical challenges,\n\nwhich are addressed with cryptographic tools that introduce significant\n\ncomputational and communication overheads (e.g. zero-knowledge proofs).\n\nIn this paper, we consider the case of games that do not require any secret\n\nstate to be maintained (e.g. Blackjack and Baccarat). Basically, in these\n\ngames, cards are chosen at random and then publicly advertised, allowing\n\nfor players to publicly announce their actions (before or after cards\n\nare known). We show that protocols for such games can be built from\n\nvery lightweight primitives such as digital signatures and canonical random\n\noracle commitments, yielding constructions that far outperform all\n\nknown card game protocols in terms of communication, computational\n\nand round complexities. Moreover, in constructing highly efficient protocols,\n\nwe introduce a new technique based on verifiable random functions\n\nfor extending coin tossing, which is at the core of our constructions. Besides\n\nensuring that the games are played correctly, our protocols support\n\nfinancial rewards and penalties enforcement, guaranteeing that winners\n\nreceive their rewards and that cheaters get financially penalized. In order\n\nto do so, we build on blockchain-based techniques that leverage the\n\npower of stateful smart contracts to ensure fair protocol execution.\n\nView full paper\n\n![IOHK logo black and white](https://ucarecdn.com/306dc384-d0ae-479a-9b7e-2814fbeaea9b/-/resize/200/)\n\n##### Products\n\n##### Media\n\n##### Courses\n\n##### Legal\n\n##### Social",
