Section II gives a general overview of the proposed ontology, and Section III gives analyses of a number of interesting smart contracts from the literature, through the lens of this ontology. The proposals here are not intended to be the One True Ontology, but rather a useful ontology. A well-designed blockchain should be able to support arbitrary such ontologies\n\nView full paper\n\n![IOHK logo black and white](https://ucarecdn.com/306dc384-d0ae-479a-9b7e-2814fbeaea9b/-/resize/200/)\n\n##### Products\n\n##### Media\n\n##### Courses\n\n##### Legal\n\n##### Social",
