Two different types of proof construction models are considered: those in which all the proofs to be built are independent (they can be considered as leaves on the Merkle tree) and those in which the proofs are located at all nodes of the Merkle tree, and hence form a partially ordered set.\n\nView full paper\n\n![IOHK logo black and white](https://ucarecdn.com/306dc384-d0ae-479a-9b7e-2814fbeaea9b/-/resize/200/)\n\n##### Products\n\n##### Media\n\n##### Courses\n\n##### Legal\n\n##### Social",
