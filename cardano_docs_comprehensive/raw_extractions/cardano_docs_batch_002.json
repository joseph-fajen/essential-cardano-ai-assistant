Instead, they are pooled and then distributed to\nall pools that created blocks during an epoch.\n\nCurrently, there are no fees for the memory cost of tracking the accumulated\nchain state, in particular, UTXO.\n\n## Preventing economic attacks[​](#preventing-economic-attacks \"Direct link to Preventing economic attacks\")\n\nThe Shelley hard fork event meant that the Cardano blockchain moved from\nfederated to a fully decentralized environment, which might increase the\nincentive for malicious actors to perpetrate economic attacks.\n\nAn economic attack might occur where the costs incurred by the operators of a\nsystem are not covered by fees on the users of a given system. These situations\nallow users to impose costs on operators without paying the full cost\nthemselves, which could potentially lead to a severe drop in operator\nparticipation, and might ultimately lead to the collapse of the system itself.\n\nTo prevent this situation from arising, it is crucially important to address\nboth the existing unaccounted operator costs and the new costs.\n\nCardano's fee structure is quite simple.\n\nFees are constructed around two constants (a and b). The formula for calculating\nminimal fees for a transaction (tx) is a \\* size(tx) + b, where:\n\n* a/b are protocol parameters\n* size(tx) is the transaction size in bytes.\n\n## Protocol parameters (a and b)[​](#protocol-parameters-a-and-b \"Direct link to Protocol parameters (a and b)\")\n\nProtocol parameters are values that can be altered by Cardano's update system to\nreact and adapt to changes in transaction volume, hardware prices, and ada\nvaluation. Changing these parameters constitutes a hard fork, since it\ninfluences which transactions are accepted by the system.\n\n**Protocol parameter a**\n\nParameter a reflects the dependence of the transaction cost on the size of the\ntransaction. The larger the transaction, the more resources are needed to store\nand process it.\n\n**Protocol parameter b**\n\nThe value of b is a payable fee, regardless of the size of the transaction. This\nparameter was primarily introduced to prevent Distributed-Denial-of-Service\n(DDoS) attacks. b makes such attacks prohibitively expensive, and eliminates the\npossibility of an attacker generating millions of small transactions to flood\nand crash the system.\n\n**Protocol parameter x**\n\nx represents the size of the transaction in bytes.\n\nOn this page\n\n* [Preventing economic attacks](#preventing-economic-attacks)\n* [Protocol parameters (a and b)](#protocol-parameters-a-and-b)",

With Voltaire, the treasury performs this\nfunction, and funding for new features, improvements, etc. is allocated\nthrough a decentralized voting system.\n\n## Stake pools[​](#stake-pools \"Direct link to Stake pools\")\n\nThe principles of decentralization and fairness drive Cardano's development.\nCardano offers equal opportunities to anyone who wishes to become part\nof the network by running a stake pool. But the very freedom to participate\nopens up the possibility of unfair advantage posed by larger stake pool\noperators. This presents the challenge of maintaining the integrity of the chain\nwhile incentivizing people to create pools and support the chain.\n\n## Incentives mechanism[​](#incentives-mechanism \"Direct link to Incentives mechanism\")\n\nCardano's monetary expansion relies on a long-term commitment by stake pool\noperators to provide ongoing support for the chain. This commitment requires a\nsolid and stable incentivization mechanism for the operators, so this mechanism\nmust ensure that the incentive system does not significantly change in time in a\nway that might adversely affect the operators’ income.\n\nCardano's incentive system for stake pool operators is designed to balance k\nfully saturated pools (where k is the number of desired pools), so this\nequilibrium means that rewards will be optimal for everybody when all stake is\ndelegated uniformly to the k most attractive pools.\n\n## Monetary policy[​](#monetary-policy \"Direct link to Monetary policy\")\n\nCardano's monetary policy addresses two issues:\n\n* the necessity to offer rewards for people who participate in the network\n* funding the treasury.\n\n**Rewards**\n\nThe expansion and future improvement of the Cardano blockchain will be greatly\ninfluenced by its community, who need to be incentivized through rewards to\nparticipate in Cardano’s development.\n\nStaking rewards for delegators and stake pool operators come from two sources:\n\n* Transaction fees - fees from every transaction from all blocks produced during\n  every epoch go into a virtual 'pot'. A fixed percentage (ρ) of the remaining\n  ada reserves is added to that pot.\n* Monetary expansion - a certain percentage (τ) of the pot is sent to the\n  treasury, and the rest is used as epoch rewards.\n\nThis system is designed to ensure that the portion of rewards taken from the\nreserves is high at the beginning when transaction numbers are still relatively\nlow. This incentivizes early adopters to move quickly to benefit from high\ninitial rewards. Over time, and as the number of transactions increases,\nadditional fees will compensate for smaller reserves.\n\nThis mechanism also ensures that available rewards are predictable and do not\nvary dramatically. Instead, rewards change gradually. The fixed percentage taken\nfrom remaining reserves every epoch guarantees a smooth exponential decline.\n\n**Funding the treasury**\n\nThe treasury's goal is the provision of funds to develop Cardano activities\nthrough a voting process. This necessitates a process whereby funds are\nregularly sent to the treasury to ensure that funds are always available.\n\n## Policy rationale for the ρ and τ values[​](#policy-rationale-for-the-ρ-and-τ-values \"Direct link to Policy rationale for the ρ and τ values\")\n\nA lot of thought was put into determining what the values for ρ (fixed\npercentage) and τ (funds going into the treasury) should be.\n\n**Calculating ρ**\n\nWhile searching for the right ρ value, the team faced a quandary: A higher value would mean higher rewards for everybody initially, and the treasury would fill faster. But higher values of ρ would also mean that the reserves would deplete faster. Paying high rewards and incentivizing early adopters is a crucial consideration, but so is to offer a long-term perspective for all stakeholders. Therefore, the solution to this quandary requires a tradeoff between these two issues.\n\nAdopting an exponential decay approach to prevent Cardano’s reserve from running out makes sense in this situation.\n\nCalculating the 'reserve half life' (that is, the time that it takes for half of the reserve to be used up) visualizes the impact of choosing a specific value of ρ over another. This was the subject of much discussion, and eventually, the value assigned was 0.3%. The reason why is that mathematical projections showed that a ρ (the fixed percentage of ada going into the virtual pot every epoch) value of 0.3% would mean a reserve half-life of four to five years. In simple terms, just half of the remaining reserve would be used every four to five years.\n\n**Choosing τ**\n\nDetermining the right value for τ (the percentage of unclaimed rewards\nautomatically going to the reserves every epoch) was equally challenging.\nFollowing discussions, deliberations, and projections, the τ value was set at a fixed rate of 20%.\n\nThis rate applies to both the per-epoch monetary expansion and the fees that the blockchain charges for each transaction. The treasury amount is deducted before any other rewards are allocated. The remaining per-epoch monetary expansion and fees may be allocated to stake pools based on the provided formula.\n\nIt is important to note that the rewards given to stake pools may be reduced under certain conditions, such as when pools are not saturated, not fully pledged, or fail to produce their allocated blocks. Any unclaimed rewards remain in the reserves for future allocation. This explains the slightly varying difference in the percentage of treasury allocations.\n\nOn this page\n\n* [Stake pools](#stake-pools)\n* [Incentives mechanism](#incentives-mechanism)\n* [Monetary policy](#monetary-policy)\n* [Policy rationale for the ρ and τ values](#policy-rationale-for-the-ρ-and-τ-values)",

Some protocol parameters are stable and non-updatable while others can be adjusted to adapt to changing conditions over time.\n\nExamples of important Cardano protocol parameters include the maximum block size, the transaction fee structure, the block production schedule, and the minimum ada balance required for staking (read more in the following sections). Parameter choices can have a significant impact on the network's performance, security, and usability, and their alteration must be carefully considered.\n\nThe Voltaire governance system for Cardano aims to provide a flexible and adaptable framework that can evolve over time. This includes monitoring and changing the various protocol parameters. The collaboration of founding entities (Input Output Global, the Cardano Foundation, and EMURGO) with the community allows for a decentralized approach to governance and decision making. Cardano can then respond to changing conditions and optimize its performance and functionality to meet the needs of its users.\n\nAdditionally, the use of protocol parameters allows for agility and innovation within the network, as new ideas and proposals can be tested and implemented without requiring a hard fork or other disruptive changes to the network's architecture. This enables Cardano to remain at the forefront of blockchain technology and provide a robust and sustainable infrastructure for decentralized applications (DApps) and services.\n\nTypes of protocol parameters on Cardano[​](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/explore-more/parameter-guide#types-of-protocol-parameters-on-cardano \"Direct link to Types of protocol parameters on Cardano\")\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCardano protocol parameters are classified as follows:\n\n*   **Network parameters** – affect Cardano’s connectivity properties and performance. Examples include the maximum number of connections allowed per node, peer discovery algorithm, the network propagation speed, block body and header size, transaction size, etc.\n*   **Economic parameters** – affect the economic aspects of blockchain operations. Examples include parameters such as the transaction fee structure, the minimum ada balance required for staking or transacting, stake pool fees, treasury settings, etc.\n*   **Technical parameters** – affect technical protocol properties like the consensus algorithm or cost models, for example. These include the stake pool pledge influence, a target number of stake pools, collateral percentage, and others.\n*   **Governance parameters** – as Voltaire is rolled out, a new class of parameters will be introduced to define the governance process.\n\nProtocol parameters are either updatable or non-updatable:\n\n*   **Updatable** parameters can be adjusted through governance processes. These parameters can be used to change the operation of the block-producing protocol, vary transaction fees, define the influence of pledge, etc.\n*   **Non-updatable** parameters affect the fundamentals of the Cardano protocol and are stable, which means that they cannot be changed except via a hard fork. Non-updatable parameters include those defining the genesis block or basic security properties, for example. Some non-updatable parameters may be embedded in the source code or implemented as software. Each major protocol version defines its own set of updatable and non-updatable parameters.\n\nUpdatable parameters are designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing the network to evolve over time in response to changing conditions and community needs. Non-updatable parameters, on the other hand, are typically set at the launch of the network or when introducing major changes to the protocol and are intended to provide a stable and secure foundation for the network's operations.\n\nA list of updatable protocol parameters[​](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/explore-more/parameter-guide#a-list-of-updatable-protocol-parameters \"Direct link to A list of updatable protocol parameters\")\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n| Parameter | Category | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| maxBlockBodySize | Network | Maximum size of a block body.

Minted blocks are expected to be propagated to all nodes in the system in a timely manner, so time requires the construction of a globally acceptable representation for consensus to be reached.\n\n## Time-handling with Ouroboros[​](#time-handling-with-ouroboros \"Direct link to Time-handling with Ouroboros\")\n\nLocally, a node computes the passing of time using a 'wall-clock' system. The code for this clock is complicated because the slot length can vary at a hard fork boundary, so the time must be computed carefully taking this into account.\n\nThe code performs four steps to get the currentSlot:\n\n1. Waits for some delay corresponding to either the time left till the next slot, or an arbitrary 60s delay if the current slot is unknown, which happens when syncing\n2. Gets current system time and translates it to a slot number according to slot length for the current era\n3. If the new slot is greater than the previous one, it 'ticks' a new current slot\n4. If the above is not true, it either waits a bit longer or reports an error if current time jumped too far back.\n\nThe local currentSlot is compared to the slot reported by the tip of the node's ledger. If the latter is older, it is ignored because this means that the node is synchronizing its state with the chain.\n\nSince the slot length can change at a hard fork, consensus can only convert slots to time up to a fixed point in the future – the 'stability window' – in which no hard forks can happen. In practice, the stability window is essential as it provides a measure of time needed to guarantee transaction finality and chain state immutability. During the stability window, the network must produce at least *k* blocks, where *k* is the number of blocks after which the chain becomes immutable. The stability window can take up to 3*k*/f, which is 36 hours with current parameters, or roughly a day.\n\n## Current challenges[​](#current-challenges \"Direct link to Current challenges\")\n\nThere is a fundamental physical limitation to the speed at which information can travel: the speed of light. This implies that synchronizing time over a network of nodes **takes time.**\n\nNetwork Time Protocol ([NTP](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-thorny-problem-of-keeping-the-internets-time)) exists to provide a synchronization mechanism, which addresses time limitations and measurement differences. On the other hand, NTP does not guarantee a monotonic increase: time can sometimes jump back and forth a few seconds or even hours. Existing systems providing accurate, precise, and reliable clocks at a global scale are *centralized*, like the global clock provided by [Spanner](https://research.google/pubs/pub39966/), for example.\n\nCurrently, on Cardano:\n\n1. Network parameters are set in such a way that the granularity of observable time intervals (eg, block time) on the chain is 20s, which is equal to the slot length (1s) divided by the block coefficient f (the expected block frequency, 0.05). These parameters are unlikely to change in the short-term future.\n2. These 20 seconds have been determined as the optimum budget to guarantee the protocol's safety, given the constraints to replicate new transactions and blocks across the network (300ms TCP delay across the globe, with thousands of nodes). While block throughput might be increased in the future, it's unlikely that it will reduce the granularity of observable on-chain time.\n3. Transaction finality can be achieved in approximately one day, and *cannot* happen in *less* than a day, according to Ouroboros consensus design. Note that although a high level of confidence is already reached in a matter of minutes or hours, the probability of a block being ultimately discarded decreases exponentially with its depth and the number of nodes that have to adopt this block.\n\nFinally, in the longer term, the current Ouroboros protocol is planned to be replaced with **[Ouroboros Chronos](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/10/27/ouroboros-chronos-provides-the-first-high-resilience-cryptographic-time-source-based-on-blockchain/)**. Ouroboros Chronos addresses the timekeeping challenges by providing the first high-resilience cryptographic time source based on blockchain technology.\n\n## The importance of determinism in a blockchain environment[​](#the-importance-of-determinism-in-a-blockchain-environment \"Direct link to The importance of determinism in a blockchain environment\")\n\nIn the current context, determinism means that a given transaction has a 'fixed effect' on the ledger state. But it is important to distinguish between the concepts of *historical* and *prospective* determinism.\n\nBlockchains are based on the principle of replicating a fixed sequence of transactions (grouped in blocks) to reach a consensus about the state of the world. All blockchains have *historical* determinism, meaning that transactions in the chain have a fixed effect, else the results of validating the chain would be non-deterministic, which would break consensus.\n\nBut few blockchains have *prospective* determinism, meaning that a transaction that has not yet been added to the chain does have a fixed effect (or won't apply). Cardano does feature prospective determinism.\n\nOn blockchains that do not have prospective determinism users cannot know how much gas fees they need to pay for transactions which then results in such users overpaying for transactions. The lack of prospective determinism is also why a risk exists that a transaction on such blockchains can fail while also consuming lots of gas.\n\n### The power of prospective determinism[​](#the-power-of-prospective-determinism \"Direct link to The power of prospective determinism\")\n\nProspective determinism is a very powerful feature of Cardano, for multiple reasons:\n\n* Users know, ahead of time, what a transaction will do, so there are no surprises. This is particularly relevant for scripts because users know exactly:\n  + how the scripts will behave, and\n  + how much execution budget is needed.\n* Proposed transactions can safely be processed in parallel. This parallelism is one of the reasons for Hydra's speed.\n* Because users know in advance whether a transaction will fail or not, script failures can be punished harshly (because they will never happen to non-malicious users).\n* Broadly, it makes interacting with, and evolving the blockchain easier and more predictable.\n\nProspective determinism of transactions requires that every part of transaction validation, including script execution, is completely deterministic. This is ultimately why Cardano cannot have non-deterministic operations in scripts.\n\nOne of the ways to get prospective determinism is by having the effect of a transaction be entirely determined by the transaction itself and the outputs it references. In the context of Cardano, this is called *locality*. Locality is also of great benefit for users since it means that anyone can know what a transaction does just by looking at the transaction.\n\n## How do Plutus scripts handle time?[​](#how-do-plutus-scripts-handle-time \"Direct link to How do Plutus scripts handle time?\")\n\nPlutus scripts get access to the transaction validity range, defined by its creator. When defining the validity range, a creator can decide that a transaction is valid from slot X to slot Y, or leave one or both of the bounds undefined. This imposes constraints into which slot a transaction can be included, which is very useful on-chain to define various 'contracts'.\n\nThe script can assume that the actual time of validation is in this range. Otherwise, the transaction will fail in [phase 1](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/09/07/no-surprises-transaction-validation-part-2/) before script execution. This ensures determinism since the script will *always* see the same piece of information (the validity range) regardless of when the script is validated, so the behavior will be the same.\n\nThe limits of the validity interval are expressed in real time (POSIXTime), rather than slots, and the conversion from slots to real time is done by consensus. Using real time rather than slots is important because slot lengths can change at a hard fork, so assumptions based on counting slots are generally unreliable. The fact that scripts see the validity range allows the scripts to make assertions like 'the current time is before/after some given time', but it does not enable a script to make any other kind of assertion ('the second in which this transaction is validated is even', for example.)\n\nIn Alonzo's original design, the validity range covered all known uses of time, while also fitting neatly with the existing time-to-live (TTL) field. In theory, it is possible to apply the same principles to other kinds of assertions, for example – let the script rely on assertions checked in phase 1. However, this would not be easy as it implies deep structural changes to various parts of the Cardano network. And because phase 1 checks need to be valid for every node across the network, this precludes any kind of assertion that depends on some local condition, like 'Current Time'.\n\n## Use cases for time[​](#use-cases-for-time \"Direct link to Use cases for time\")\n\nTime has different applications in the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n### Hydra[​](#hydra \"Direct link to Hydra\")\n\nThe Hydra protocol is dependent on time to compute and enforce the contestation deadline, which is a critical part of the protocol's safety mechanism. The Hydra Head state machine tracks the passage of time using UTCTime but the tick comes from the chain, based on the slot number observed from blocks produced by the chain. The reason for using UTCTime addresses the limitations inherent in the slot-to-time conversion the validity window imposes. One cannot convert a slot too far in the future, which means that it is simpler to use UTCTime off-chain and only do conversions when submitting/receiving transactions to or from the chain.\n\nThis implies that the tick's granularity is roughly 20s, as this is the expected frequency at which blocks are produced. Using this measure of time, Hydra is available to react to the protocol-relevant crossing of the contestation deadline.\n\nWhat's important is that local time in the Hydra Head (and nodes) is tied to the on-chain time handled by Ouroboros. As Hydra is an isomorphic protocol, it is desirable to process 'timed transactions' also on layer 2 (see [issue #196](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/issues/196)). However, Hydra does not produce blocks, so the consensus itself does not need a notion of time (yet).\n\nThis requires an understanding of the precision and process of discretizing time on a layer 2 ledger. Although the complexities of handling time on-chain also apply to layer 2, layer 2 can provide better solutions since such networks are much smaller, have a shorter lifespan, and do not need to scale globally.\n\nIf you're interested in getting involved in discussions and sharing the types of applications you have and the resolution time they'd require, join this [Hydra Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/826816523368005654/890903732462710836/890951034099335178).\n\n### Marlowe[​](#marlowe \"Direct link to Marlowe\")\n\nMarlowe is a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing financial and transactional contracts, nearly all of which involve time. A wide variety of standard financial contracts have been written in Marlowe, including most of the [ACTUS](https://www.actusfrf.org/) standard contracts (eg, loans, swaps, options, and derivatives). Furthermore, Marlowe supports a variety of non-financial contract types such as auctions, token swaps, and even games. Cardano's existing mechanisms for working with time dovetail nicely with Marlowe's semantics and provide Marlowe transactions with locality and determinism inherited from Plutus.\n\nIn Marlowe, contract's time typically appears in the deadlines and timeouts that constrain how the execution of the contract evolves, and this works perfectly with Cardano's validity intervals. The timeout logic is needed in a loan contract, for example, to handle the situation where a loan payment is missed: then different logic needs to be executed in order to impose a penalty, adjust the schedule of future payments, etc. Contracts may also directly use the time endpoints of the validity interval in numerical computations, perhaps to adjust future payment amounts based on when an early payment was received. The fact that time appears as an interval has little practical impact on Marlowe because the interval can be as short as the time taken from submitting a transaction to its appearing in a block on the Cardano network – just a few minutes.\n\n## Solutions[​](#solutions \"Direct link to Solutions\")\n\nCardano could potentially provide more accurate time-related data during transaction validation, such as the timestamp from the block producer at which the block was minted, converted from its slot, or even the actual timestamp in UTC with milliseconds precision. However, this would *break prospective determinism* as it does on protocols which do not include this feature: a user could no longer tell if a transaction can definitely apply to the ledger or not, because that would depend on the exact timestamp that the block producer used when creating the block.\n\nAnother option is adding various assertion kinds to transaction bodies beyond the validity interval. This is possible, but difficult as already outlined before, hence there needs to be a use case for these assertion kinds to be useful.\n\nFinally, layer 2 networks such as Hydra, can provide increased accuracy through shorter 'slot length' and shorter validity range, alongside decreased latency in transactions finality. Note that the current Hydra Head implementation does not *yet* provide that level of flexibility.\n\n## Conclusion[​](#conclusion \"Direct link to Conclusion\")\n\nTime *is* a complex topic, especially in a decentralized blockchain setting. There is a clear notion of on-chain time on Cardano with specific constraints and available improvement options in the longer term.\n\nOn-chain time behaves in a somewhat different way from the time in traditional software. This divergence is defined in a consistent way to address system constraints while ensuring security and usability for end-users and stake pool operators. Moreover, Cardano's measure of time appears to be good enough to cover multiple use cases, even when compared to traditional finance uses.\n\nOn this page\n\n* [Time-handling with Ouroboros](#time-handling-with-ouroboros)\n* [Current challenges](#current-challenges)\n* [The importance of determinism in a blockchain environment](#the-importance-of-determinism-in-a-blockchain-environment)\n  + [The power of prospective determinism](#the-power-of-prospective-determinism)\n* [How do Plutus scripts handle time?](#how-do-plutus-scripts-handle-time)\n* [Use cases for time](#use-cases-for-time)\n  + [Hydra](#hydra)\n  + [Marlowe](#marlowe)\n* [Solutions](#solutions)\n* [Conclusion](#conclusion)",

        "raw_content": "# Governance overview\n\nGovernance in Cardano has evolved significantly since the introduction of Cardano Improvement Proposal #1694 ([CIP-1694](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-1694)), which laid the foundation for a more decentralized and community-driven decision-making process. Named after the birth year of the philosopher Voltaire, this proposal marks the transition to the [Voltaire development phase](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/voltaire/), where governance is self-sustaining and controlled by the Cardano community.\n\nCIP-1694 introduces a tripartite governance structure consisting of delegated representatives (DReps), the constitutional committee, and [stake pool operators (SPOs)](/stake-pool-operators/about-stake-pools). These bodies work together to review and approve governance actions, which can be submitted by anyone, ensuring a transparent and democratic process.\n\nCardano’s self-sustaining governance requires the following roles to function properly:\n\n* **Ada owners:** the ones who have ‘skin in the game’\n* **DReps:** the ones delegated voting power by ada owners\n* **SPOs:** the block producers who maintain the network and vote on certain governance actions\n* **Constitutional committee:** the elected representatives who ensure governance actions comply with the Cardano constitution.\n\nAs with stake pools, any ada owner may register to be a DRep and represent themselves and/or others. Also, as with stake pools, ada owners may, instead, delegate their voting rights to any DRep. Voting rights are based on the total ada that is delegated, as a whole number of lovelaces (one ada = 1,000,000 lovelaces).\n\n## Driven by the Cardano constitution[​](#driven-by-the-cardano-constitution \"Direct link to Driven by the Cardano constitution\")\n\nThe Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution (‘[Cardano constitution](https://constitution.gov.tools/en/constitution)') is designed to be the founding document that brings together the community’s values and vision and puts them into text as a set of rules and principles to abide by to maintain the sustainability of the Cardano network.\n\n## Why bother?[​](#why-bother \"Direct link to Why bother?\")\n\nThe pioneer entities of Cardano – EMURGO, Input | Output, and the Cardano Foundation – have relinquished the genesis keys of the blockchain, handing a more mature governance system to the community. Now, the community must take up the challenge and take Cardano to the next level, which means all ada owners must get involved.\n\nThese off-chain elements are where Intersect fits in. Becoming an Intersect member offers many opportunities to be involved in framing and maturing Cardano’s governance, much of which happens off-chain.\n\nIn addition to Intersect membership, other opportunities include participating in the [Cardano forum](https://forum.cardano.org/) and social networks.\n\nJoin Cardano’s community in guiding its future and encouraging its mass adoption to ensure the success of the most decentralized blockchain. See the sections below for more details.\n\n## How to participate[​](#how-to-participate \"Direct link to How to participate\")\n\nTo get involved with decentralized decision-making, start with choosing and installing a governance-compatible wallet. Intersect MBO maintains a [current list](https://docs.gov.tools/cardano-govtool/using-govtool/getting-started/compatible-wallets). Then, check out the [governance tools documentation](https://docs.gov.tools) to see what you can do and how.\n\nYou can use governance tools to delegate your voting power to a DRep, become a DRep yourself, review and vote on governance actions, submit your own governance action, and more.\n\nUseful resources:\n\n* [How to become a DRep](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano/cardano-governance/governance-roles/delegated-representatives-dreps)\n* [DRep Pioneer program](https://dreppioneeringprogram.docs.intersectmbo.org/)\n* [How to delegate your voting power](https://docs.gov.tools/cardano-govtool/using-govtool/delegating)\n* [How to vote on governance actions.](https://docs.gov.tools/cardano-govtool/using-govtool/governance-actions/vote-on-governance-actions)\n\n## Governance in more detail[​](#governance-in-more-detail \"Direct link to Governance in more detail\")\n\nAny ada owner can submit a governance action on the Cardano blockchain. Every governance action must be ratified by at least two of the three governance bodies by on-chain votes. The type of action and the state of the governance system determine which bodies must ratify it.\n\nThe constitutional committee votes on the basis of one member, one vote. SPOs and DReps vote on the basis of one lovelace, one vote.\n\n| Governance action | Name | CC vote | DRep vote | SPO vote |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Motion of no-confidence | - | ✓ | ✓ |\n| 2a | Update committee/threshold (normal state) | - | ✓ | ✓ |\n| 2b | Update committee/threshold (state of no-confidence) | - | ✓ | ✓ |\n| 3 | New constitution or guardrails script | ✓ | ✓ | - |\n| 4 | Hard fork initiation | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |\n| 5a | Protocol parameter changes, network group | ✓ | ✓ | - |\n| 5b | Protocol parameter changes, economic group | ✓ | ✓ | - |\n| 5c | Protocol parameter changes, technical group | ✓ | ✓ | - |\n| 5d | Protocol parameter changes, governance group | ✓ | ✓ | - |\n| 6 | Treasury withdrawal | ✓ | ✓ | - |\n| 7 | Info | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |\n\nThere is a separate protocol parameter that sets the minimum yes vote for each DRep and SPO vote for each governance action. Some parameters are relevant to security properties of the system. Any proposal attempting to change such a parameter requires an additional vote of the SPO. For more details, see CIP-1694.\n\n## The Intersect member-based organization[​](#the-intersect-member-based-organization \"Direct link to The Intersect member-based organization\")\n\nIntersect MBO is a not-for-profit organization incorporated in Wyoming, USA. Created to support the new governance system, Intersect helps ensure the continuity and future development of Cardano and facilitates governance processes. It fulfills this role with a management board and a number of advisory committees that coordinate the ongoing maintenance and development of the Cardano blockchain and ecosystem. Committees are elected by Intersect members in elections that Intersect facilitates twice a year. Any interested community member or organization can become an Intersect member. Members vote in committee elections on the basis of one member, one vote, regardless of ada holdings.\n\nThere are three membership tiers:\n\n* **Associate level**: free to join, invited to community events and kept informed of community news\n* **Individual level**: a small fee to join (currently US$10.00), entitled to vote in Intersect elections, eligible to serve on Intersect committees, and can apply for grants\n* **Enterprise level**: a larger fee to join (currently US$1,000), all the benefits of an individual, with company profile posted on the Intersect website and the annual report.\n\nThe benefits listed above are a summary; for details and how to join, see the [Intersect website](https://www.intersectmbo.org/membership).\n\nOn this page\n\n* [Driven by the Cardano constitution](#driven-by-the-cardano-constitution)\n* [Why bother?](#why-bother)\n* [How to participate](#how-to-participate)\n* [Governance in more detail](#governance-in-more-detail)\n* [The Intersect member-based organization](#the-intersect-member-based-organization)\n\n ",

To learn more, view the following link:    [Privacy Policy](https://static.iohk.io/terms/iog-privacy-policy.pdf)[Cookie Policy](https://static.iohk.io/terms/iog-cookie-policy.pdf)\n\n[Skip to main content](#__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)\n\n# Cardano addresses\n\nThe addresses are a blake2b-224 hash of the relevant verifying/public keys\nconcatenated with some metadata that can be stored on the\n[Cardano blockchain](https://cardano.org/).\n\nShelley introduced four different types of addresses:\n\n* base addresses\n* pointer addresses\n* enterprise addresses\n* reward account addresses.\n\nBesides those new addresses, Shelley continued to support Byron-era *bootstrap\naddresses* and *script addresses*, but only the new base and pointer addresses\ncarried stake rights. Therefore, addresses consist of some serialized data\nspecified in the ledger specification stored in the blockchain’s blocks, eg, an\nUnspent Transaction Output (UTXO) address.\n\nThe serialized data (address) contains two parts:\n\n* metadata: used for interpreting\n* payload: the raw or encoded data.\n\n## Base addresses[​](#base-addresses \"Direct link to Base addresses\")\n\nA base address directly specifies the staking key that should control the stake\nfor that address. The staking rights associated with funds held in this address\nmay be exercised by the owner of the staking key. Base addresses can be used in\ntransactions without registering the staking key in advance.\n\nThe stake rights can only be exercised by registering the stake key and\ndelegating to a stake pool. Once the stake key is\nregistered, the stake rights can be exercised for base addresses used in\ntransactions before or after the key registration.\n\n## Pointer addresses[​](#pointer-addresses \"Direct link to Pointer addresses\")\n\nA pointer address indirectly specifies the staking key that should control the\nstake for the address. It references a stake key by a stake key pointer, which\nis a location on the blockchain of the stake key registration certificate for\nthat key. Pointer addresses can be used in transactions, even if their target is\nnot an active stake key registration. This covers the scenario where the key was\nunregistered after (or indeed, before) the transaction, and also covers pointers\nto targets that are plainly invalid. The reason for allowing such invalid\ntargets is so that nodes only need to track the *currently active* stake keys.\n\nThe pointer can be considerably shorter than the hash used in base addresses.\n\nThere is a subtlety with pointer addresses. It might happen that a stake key\nregistration certificate referenced by a pointer address might be lost due to a\nrollback. To prevent loss of funds in this scenario, the system considers\npointer addresses with an invalid pointer to be *valid* for the purpose of using\nfunds stored therein as inputs for transactions (but ignores them for the\npurpose of proof of stake participation). Optionally, a wallet might refuse to\ncreate transactions to pointer addresses before the referenced certificate has\nbecome immutable, to prevent funds from being excluded from the proof of stake,\nin the case of rollbacks.\n\n## Enterprise addresses[​](#enterprise-addresses \"Direct link to Enterprise addresses\")\n\nEnterprise addresses carry no stake rights, so using these addresses means that\nyou are opting out of participation in the proof-of-stake protocol.\n\nExchanges or other organizations that control large amounts of ada – but hold it\non behalf of other users – may wish to follow a policy of not exercising stake\nrights. By using enterprise addresses, exchanges can demonstrate that they\nfollow this policy. Since enterprise addresses are not associated with any\nstaking key, they are automatically excluded from the mechanisms that influence\nthe slot leadership schedule. Note that using addresses with no stake rights\neffectively decreases the total amount of stake, which plays into the hands of a\npotential adversary.\n\nAlso note that enterprise addresses may still be used to receive, hold, and send  \ntokens with a policyID (non-ada assets).\n\n## Reward account addresses[​](#reward-account-addresses \"Direct link to Reward account addresses\")\n\nA reward address is a cryptographic hash of the public staking key of the\naddress. Reward account addresses are used to distribute rewards for\nparticipating in the proof-of-stake protocol (either directly or via\ndelegation).\n\nThey have the following properties:\n\n* account-style accounting is used, not UTXO-style\n* funds cannot be received via transactions; instead, their balance is only\n  increased when rewards are distributed\n* a one-to-one correspondence exists between registered staking keys and reward\n  account addresses.\n\nThis key is used whenever funds are withdrawn from the address. Furthermore,\nstake associated with funds in the address contributes to the stake of this key.\nJust as in the case of enterprise addresses, the staking object for a reward\naddress does not need to contain information.\n\nOn this page\n\n* [Base addresses](#base-addresses)\n* [Pointer addresses](#pointer-addresses)\n* [Enterprise addresses](#enterprise-addresses)\n* [Reward account addresses](#reward-account-addresses)",

Cold keys must be secure and should not reside on a device with internet connectivity. It is recommended to keep multiple backups of cold keys.\n\n#### KES key pair[​](#kes-key-pair \"Direct link to KES key pair\")\n\nTo create an operational certificate for a block-producing node, you need a KES key pair, which authenticates who you are.\n\nA KES key can only evolve for a certain number of periods and becomes useless afterwards. This is useful, because even if an attacker compromises the key and gets access to the signing key, he can only use that to sign blocks from now on, but not blocks dating from earlier periods, making it impossible for the attacker to rewrite history.\n\nAfter the set number of periods has passed, the node operator must generate a new KES key pair, issue a new operational node certificate with that new key pair, and restart the node with the new certificate.\n\n#### VRF keys[​](#vrf-keys \"Direct link to VRF keys\")\n\nOuroboros Praos adds an extra layer of security to block production via VRF keys.\n\nIn other proof-of-stake blockchain protocols (Ouroboros Classic or BFT, for instance), we know who has the right to make the block in each slot, because the slot leader schedule is public. In this case, you only have to prove that you are who you say you are, and everyone can check the public slot leader schedule to verify it.\n\nHowever, Ouroboros Praos's slot leader schedule is kept private, which means that nobody knows in advance who is going to be the slot leader, but once someone is, they can prove to everyone else that they are using the VRF key.\n\nThe VRF key is a signing verification key stored within the operational certificate. It proves that a node has the right to create a block in a given slot.\n\n### Address keys[​](#address-keys \"Direct link to Address keys\")\n\nAddress keys represent the functions of the addresses derived from the keys for identifying funds on the blockchain that consist of the following keys:\n\n* Payment key: single address key pair usually used for generating UTXO addresses\n* Staking key: stake/reward address key pair usually used for generating account/reward addresses.\n\ninfo\n\nDeveloper resources:\n\n* [Creating keys and addresses](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-wiki/wiki/3_keys_and_addresses)\n* [Creating KES key pair](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-wiki/wiki/7_KES_period)\n* [Generating stake pool keys](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900001331786-Generate-stake-pool-keys)\n* [Generating payment/staking keys and address](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900001219883-Generating-payment-staking-keys-and-address)\n\nOn this page\n\n* [Types of keys](#types-of-keys)\n  + [Node keys](#node-keys)\n  + [Address keys](#address-keys)",

Network nodes connect to each other within the networking layer, which is the driving force for delivering information exchange requirements. This includes new block diffusion and transaction information for establishing a better data flow. Cardano nodes maintain connections with peers that have been chosen via a custom peer-selection process. By running a Cardano node, you are participating in and contributing to the network.\n\nHow does it work?[​](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/cardano-node#how-does-it-work \"Direct link to How does it work?\")\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Stake pools](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/stake-pools) use the Cardano node to validate how the pool interacts with the network and are responsible for transaction processing and block production. They act as reliable server nodes that hold and maintain the combined stake of various stakeholders in a single entity.\n\nProducing a block[​](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/cardano-node#producing-a-block \"Direct link to Producing a block\")\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe goal of blockchain technology is the production of an independently-verifiable and cryptographically-linked chain of records (blocks). A network of block producers works to collectively advance the blockchain. A [consensus](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/consensus-explained) protocol provides transparency and decides which candidate blocks should be used to extend the chain.\n\nSubmitted valid transactions might be included in any new block. A block is cryptographically signed by its producer and linked to the previous block in the chain. This makes it impossible to delete transactions from a block, alter the order of the blocks, remove a block from the chain (if it already has a number of other blocks following it), or insert a new block into the chain without alerting all the network participants. This ensures the integrity and transparency of the blockchain expansion.\n\nSlots and epochs[​](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/cardano-node#slots-and-epochs \"Direct link to Slots and epochs\")\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Cardano blockchain uses the [Ouroboros Praos](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/573.pdf) protocol to facilitate consensus on the chain. Ouroboros Praos divides time into epochs. Each Cardano epoch consists of a number of slots, where each slot lasts for one second. A Cardano epoch currently includes 432,000 slots (5 days). In any slot, zero or more block-producing nodes might be nominated to be the slot leader. On average, one node is expected to be nominated every 20 seconds, for a total of 21,600 nominations per epoch. If randomly elected slot leaders produce blocks, one of them will be added to the chain. Other candidate blocks will be discarded.\n\n### Slot leader election[​](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/cardano-node#slot-leader-election \"Direct link to Slot leader election\")\n\nThe Cardano network consists of a number of stake pools that control the aggregated stake of their owners and other stakeholders, also known as _delegators_. Slot leaders are randomly elected from among the stake pools. The more stake a pool controls, the greater the chance it has of being elected as a slot leader to produce a new block that is accepted into the blockchain. This is the basic concept of [proof of stake (PoS)](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/new-to-cardano/proof-of-stake). To maintain a level playing field, and prevent a situation where a small number of very large pools control the majority of stake, Cardano has an incentive system that discourages delegation to pools that already control a large portion of the total stake.\n\n### Transaction validation[​](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/cardano-node#transaction-validation \"Direct link to Transaction validation\")\n\nWhen validating a transaction, a slot leader needs to ensure that the sender has included enough funds to pay for that transaction _and_ must also ensure that the transaction’s parameters are met. Assuming that the transaction meets all these requirements, the slot leader will record it as a part of a new block, which will then be connected to other blocks in the chain.\n\ninfo\n\nRelated topics:\n\n*   [About the Cardano network](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/explore-more/cardano-network)\n\n[Previous What is a smart contract?](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/new-to-cardano/what-is-a-smart-contract)[Next Stake pools](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/stake-pools)\n\nOn this page\n*   [How does it work?](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/cardano-node#how-does-it-work)\n*   [Producing a block](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/cardano-node#producing-a-block)\n*   [Slots and epochs](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/cardano-node#slots-and-epochs)\n    *   [Slot leader election](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/cardano-node#slot-leader-election)\n    *   [Transaction validation](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/cardano-node#transaction-validation)\n\n![Image 2: Cardano Logo](https://docs.cardano.org/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n\nMore About Cardano\n\n*   [Cardano Explorer](https://cardanoexplorer.com/)\n*   [Cardano Foundation](https://cardanofoundation.org/)\n*   [Cardano.org](https://www.cardano.org/)\n*   [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/)\n\nJoin the community\n\n*   [Cardano Community](https://cardano.org/)\n*   [Cardano Telegram](https://t.me/CardanoAnnouncements/)\n*   [Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/)\n*   [Cardano Blog](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/)\n*   [IOHK](https://www.iohk.io/)\n*   [IOHK blog](https://www.iohk.io/blog/)\n*   [IOHK YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBJ0p9aCW-W82TwNM-z3V2w)\n*   [Cardano Foundation YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbQ9vGfezru1YRI1zDCtTGg)\n*   [Cardano Foundation Twitter](https://twitter.com/Cardano_CF)\n*   [IOG Academy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX9j__vYOJu00iqBrCzecVw)\n\nFollow us\n\n*   [X](https://twitter.com/inputoutputHK)\n*   [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/iohk.io/)\n*   [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/IohkIo)\n*   [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/)\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nEmail* \n\n*   - [x] By checking this box, I agree to allow IOG to store and process the personal data submitted on this form in accordance with the IOG [Privacy Policy](https://static.iohk.io/terms/iog-privacy-policy.pdf)* \n\nCardano is an open-source project.

The main reason for\ntwo-phase validation is to limit the amount of uncompensated\nvalidation work by nodes. Each phase serves a purpose in achieving this goal:\n\n* The first phase checks whether the transaction is constructed correctly and\n  can pay its processing fee\n* The second phase runs the scripts included in the transaction.\n\nIf the transaction is *phase-1 valid*, phase-2 scripts run. If phase-1 fails, no\nscripts run, and the transaction is immediately discarded.\n\nCollateral is used to guarantee that nodes are compensated for their work in\ncase phase-2 validation fails. Thus, collateral is the monetary guarantee a user\ngives to assure that the contract has been carefully designed and thoroughly\ntested. The collateral amount is specified at the time of constructing the\ntransaction. Not directly, but by adding collateral inputs to the transaction.\nThe total balance in the UTXOs corresponding to these specially marked inputs is\nthe transaction’s collateral amount. If the user fulfills the conditions of the\nguarantee, and a contract gets executed, the collateral is safe.\n\n## The scenario[​](#the-scenario \"Direct link to The scenario\")\n\nWithout collateral, the user is not charged if a smart contract fails. However,\nby the time the transaction fails, the network has already incurred some costs\nto initiate and validate the transaction. This means that a malicious actor\ncould flood the network with invalid transactions, denying service to other\nusers at little cost.\n\n## The solution[​](#the-solution \"Direct link to The solution\")\n\nWhen a user initiates a transaction, they commit enough ada to cover its\nexecution cost. On Cardano, transactions that call and use non-native smart\ncontracts (known as phase-2 contracts) also need enough collateral to cover\ncosts related to potential transaction failures. This amount can be small, but\nit is sufficient to make a denial of service (DOS) attack prohibitively\nexpensive.\n\nCollateral fees are collected only if a transaction fails validation. If the\ncontract passes validation, the transaction fees are collected, but the\ncollateral is not.\n\n## The reasoning[​](#the-reasoning \"Direct link to The reasoning\")\n\nAn honest user is *never* at risk of losing their collateral.\n\nThe [Cardano](https://cardano.org/) blockchain is deterministic with respect to\ntransaction costs because these costs depend only on local values and local\nstate. That means a user can calculate the execution cost (in ada) of a\ntransaction before submitting it. This feature is different from other\nblockchains, including Ethereum, where other network activity can influence the\ngas cost. The required amount of collateral depends only on the execution cost.\n\nThe Cardano testnet\nprovides a safe environment with free test ada, so decentralized application\n(DApp) developers can thoroughly test their smart contracts before deploying them to\nmainnet. If transactions succeed on testnet, the developer can be\nperfectly sure that all the scripts will indeed succeed.\n\nIf the on-chain conditions have changed since the transaction was constructed,\nthat transaction will be rejected entirely, and no fees will be charged. If a\nsignature is missing, for example, no collateral would be charged.\n\n## Technical details[​](#technical-details \"Direct link to Technical details\")\n\nThe term collateral refers to the total ada contained in the UTXOs referenced by\ncollateral inputs. A transaction uses collateral inputs to cover its fees if a\nphase-2 script fails.\n\nThe Shelley formal specification introduced the concept of 'multi-signature'\nscripts. Phase-1 scripts, such as these, are captured entirely by the ledger\nrules. Execution costs can therefore be easily assessed before they are\nprocessed by the implementation, and any fees can be calculated directly within\nthe ledger rule implementation, based on the size of the transaction that\nincludes the script, for example.\n\nIn contrast, phase-2 scripts can perform arbitrary (and, in principle,\nTuring-complete) computations. Cardano requires transactions that use phase-2 scripts\nto have a budget in terms of a number of abstract ExUnits. This budget gives a\nquantitative bound on resource usage in terms of a number of specific metrics,\nincluding memory usage or abstract execution steps. The budget is then used as\npart of the transaction fee calculation.\n\nAfter the Vasil upgrade, DApp developers can also specify a\nchange address for the script collateral. This means that in case the script\nfails phase-2 validation, only the right amount will be taken, and the remaining\nfunds will be sent to the provided change address. The\n[how to use collateral outputs](https://github.com/perturbing/vasil-tests/blob/main/collateral-output-cip-40.md)\ntutorial provides more details.\n\nOn this page\n\n* [The scenario](#the-scenario)\n* [The solution](#the-solution)\n* [The reasoning](#the-reasoning)\n* [Technical details](#technical-details)",

In Cardano's Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTXO) model, transactions can be processed in parallel, enabling multiple operations without causing system failures. This approach enhances system throughput while maintaining the performance of individual operations.\n\nThe EUTXO model, employed by Cardano, allows for secure and predictable execution of smart contracts. By splitting logic across different branches and utilizing multiple UTXOs, Cardano achieves greater parallelism, leading to improved scalability.\n\nThe level of concurrency sets the limit for simultaneous operations. Developers should adopt strategies to minimize contention and translate concurrency into parallelism, which may involve a learning curve but yields significant benefits.\n\nLearn more:\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project.

It is the first blockchain platform to\nevolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach.\n\nThe Cardano platform has been designed from the ground up and verified by an\nindustry-leading combination of top engineers and academic experts in the fields\nof blockchain and cryptography. It has a strong focus on sustainability,\nscalability, and transparency. It is a fully open source project that aims to\ndeliver an inclusive, fair, and resilient infrastructure for financial and\nsocial applications on a global scale. One of its primary goals is to bring\nreliable, secure financial services to those people who do not currently have\naccess.\n\nCardano has been designed with security as one of its founding principles. It is\nwritten in Haskell, a functional programming language. In a functional language\nlike Haskell, building your system using pure functions is encouraged, which\nleads to a design where components are conveniently testable in isolation.\nFurthermore, advanced features of Haskell enable employing a whole range of\npowerful methods for ensuring the correctness of the code, such as basing the\nimplementation on formal and executable specifications, extensive property-based\ntesting, and running tests in simulation.\n\nCardano's smart contract platform seeks to deliver more advanced features than\nany protocol previously developed and will serve as a stable and secure platform\nfor the development of enterprise-level DApps. Cardano's democratic governance\nsystem, being implemented based on\n[CIP-1694](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-1694) on-chain governance\nmechanisms, will enable the project to evolve over time and sustainably fund\nitself through a visionary treasury system.\n\nYou can read more about Cardano on the\n[official Cardano website](https://cardano.org/) and watch a summary of\nCardano's mission in this\n[explainer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_Nv0-PVrnM/).\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project.

In this way, the system validates and adds\nblocks to the chain and also verifies transactions. A distributed network of\nnodes must keep communication delays to a minimum, and be resilient enough to\ncope with failures or capacity constraints.\n\nIn the Byron federated system, nodes were connected by a static configuration\nthat was defined in a topology file. Since the introduction of Shelley, the\nsystem has been functioning in a hybrid mode. Moving from the federated state of\nnetwork connectivity to the hybrid one, the teams delivered a manually\nconstructed P2P network of SPO relay nodes. This means that SPO block-producing\nnodes can connect to both trusted relay nodes and other SPO-run relay nodes.\nHybrid connectivity is not automated, however, it enables the exchange of block\nand transaction information without relying on trusted relays only.\n\nA trusted relay is the one that the SPO, wallet, or exchange accessing the\nnetwork ‘trusts’. Though this role has mostly been performed by IOG, other\nentities, such as the Cardano Foundation, a wallet, or exchanges can also run\ntrusted relays. Block-producing nodes can connect to any relays they deem\ntrustable.\n\n![federated](https://ucarecdn.com/dcd6bf70-5c73-4fbc-8683-1f199e8f554b/)\n\n![federated](https://ucarecdn.com/dcd6bf70-5c73-4fbc-8683-1f199e8f554b/)\n\n![hybrid](https://ucarecdn.com/3e7d4b86-040c-416a-9eda-076e8ffe41c9/)\n\n![hybrid](https://ucarecdn.com/3e7d4b86-040c-416a-9eda-076e8ffe41c9/)\n\n![dynamic-p2p](https://ucarecdn.com/48167b72-9192-42e0-a367-5f3e40612388/)\n\n![dynamic-p2p](https://ucarecdn.com/48167b72-9192-42e0-a367-5f3e40612388/)\n\nTo ensure efficient communication between nodes, it is desirable to enable\nautomated connections of SPO relays to each other, so that less static\nconfiguration is needed. Dynamic P2P has been gradually enabled since the node\n[v.1.35.6](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/1.35.6)\nrelease. For more details, see\n[this blog post](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2023/03/16/dynamic-p2p-is-coming-to-cardano/).\n\nWith the deployment of Dynamic P2P, networking keeps evolving with\nadditions such as Ouroboros Genesis and peer sharing:\n\n![genesis](https://ucarecdn.com/9ce084f4-28d6-4557-919e-d60a18ded168/)\n\n![genesis](https://ucarecdn.com/9ce084f4-28d6-4557-919e-d60a18ded168/)\n\n![peer-sharing](https://ucarecdn.com/9359a2da-a6ed-4edd-89b4-508ae96145e7/)\n\n![peer-sharing](https://ucarecdn.com/9359a2da-a6ed-4edd-89b4-508ae96145e7/)\n\n## Dynamic P2P capabilities[​](#dynamic-p2p-capabilities \"Direct link to Dynamic P2P capabilities\")\n\nThe network stack undergoes a number of improvements to achieve the desired\nnetwork resilience. These improvements do not require a protocol change, but\nrather enable automated peer selection and communication between peers and\nnodes.\n\nThe P2P networking is enabled due to the use of the following components:\n\nNext, we take a closer look at how the outbound governor works to ensure\nautomated connectivity between peer nodes on the network.\n\n### Outbound governor functionality[​](#outbound-governor-functionality \"Direct link to Outbound governor functionality\")\n\nThe Cardano network consists of multiple peer nodes. Some peer nodes are more\nactive than others, some have established connections, and some should be\npromoted to ensure the best system performance. Each block-producing node\nmaintains a set of peers mapped into three categories:\n\nNewly discovered peers are initially added to the cold peer set. The outbound\ngovernor is then responsible for peer connection management: it defines which\npeers are beneficial for connection purposes, and which should be promoted or\ndemoted between cold, warm, or hot sets.\n\nThe primary goal of the outbound governor is to maintain the target number of\ncold, warm, and hot peers. This builds and maintains a connectivity map of the\nlocal part of the network, and simplifies the process of connection definitions\nby handling them automatically.\n\nTo establish connectivity between nodes, the outbound governor engages in the\nfollowing activities:\n\nThe outbound governor needs to establish and maintain:\n\n![peer-discovery](https://ucarecdn.com/b6bae79e-5960-4d4e-9f6c-993a100b01c3/)\n\n![peer-discovery](https://ucarecdn.com/b6bae79e-5960-4d4e-9f6c-993a100b01c3/)\n\nUsing 2–20 hot peers is cost-efficient, as peers exchange only their block\nheaders. The block body, in turn, is typically requested only once, and it tends\nto follow the shortest path through the connectivity graph.\n\nThe purpose of warm peers is to provide access to those peers that can be\nquickly promoted to hot ones (in case any of the hot peers fail), and also\nprovide candidates for the churn of hot peers.\n\nThe policy for selecting which warm peers to promote to hot relies on the\nupstream measurements. The purpose of a degree of churn between cold and warm\npeers is, in part, to discover the network distance between more peers and to\nallow potentially better warm peers to take over from existing hot peers. This\nenables further optimization and adjustments. Maintaining diversity in hop\ndistances contributes to better block distribution times across the globally\ndistributed network.\n\nOverall, this approach follows a common pattern for probabilistic search or\noptimization that uses a balance of local optimization with some elements of\nhigher-order disruption to avoid becoming trapped in a poor local optimum.\n\nPeers maintain a limited set of information, which is based on their previous\ndirect interactions. Cold peers, for instance, may not maintain any data, as\nthey have not established interactions yet. Such data can be compared to a\n‘reputation’ property, however, these details are purely local and are not\nshared among other nodes. Local peer reputation information is also updated when\npeer connections fail. The network does not maintain negative peer information\nfor extended periods of time: to bound resources and because of the simplicity\nof\n[Sybil attacks](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2018/10/29/preventing-sybil-attacks/).\n\nThe implementation classifies exceptions that cause connection failures into\nthree classes:\n\nIn the case of adversarial behavior, the peer can be immediately demoted from\nthe hot, warm, or cold sets.\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project.

The time between now and the point when chain confirmation for a particular transaction occurs is called the *stability window* (that is, the number of slots required for a block to become **stable**, where *stable* is defined as a block that cannot be rolled back). The formula to calculate this window is 3k/f (where k is the security parameter in genesis, and f is the active slot co-efficient parameter in genesis that determines the probability for amount of blocks created in an epoch.)\n\n## Transaction confirmation[​](#transaction-confirmation \"Direct link to Transaction confirmation\")\n\nThis is the point in time when a transaction is accepted into the chain and becomes immutable. The concepts of block depth and settlement window come into play here.\n\nA transaction can be considered confirmed if the block that contains it is deep enough in the chain. *Deep enough* is a relative concept: the depth of a block indicates how many more blocks have been added to the chain since that particular block was appended to it. And because blocks have depth, so do the transactions contained in them.\n\nIf the depth of a particular block is greater than a pre-defined threshold, the transaction is considered to be confirmed, and the assets in that transaction can be used 'safely' (ie, the protocol guarantees that the transaction has become immutable, so the assets can be traded, exchanged, etc.)\n\nThe time period that elapses between the point when a transaction is confirmed, and when the transaction's assets can be used to exchange with other assets is called the *settlement window*.\n\n## Likelihood of immutability[​](#likelihood-of-immutability \"Direct link to Likelihood of immutability\")\n\nAnother way of determining whether or not a transaction is confirmed is by considering the transaction's *likelihood of immutability*. The probability of a transaction being immutable depends on how many blocks have been added to the chain since that transaction was accepted into the chain. The more blocks added, the higher the probability that the transaction will become immutable.\n\nA transaction becomes immutable as soon as its depth is greater than 3k/f slots. This is guaranteed by the [Ouroboros Praos protocol](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/573.pdf). However, 3k/f slots normally exceed the requirements in most situations, so a more practical approach is to consider the probability for a transaction to become immutable. In this case, we consider that a transaction is confirmed if the probability for it to become immutable is *high enough*.\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project.

An agreement must be made on which blocks to produce,\nwhich chain to adopt and to determine the single state of the network. The\nconsensus protocol determines how individual nodes assess the current state of\nthe ledger system and reach a consensus.\n\nBlockchains create consensus by allowing participants to bundle transactions\nthat others have submitted to the system in blocks, and add them to their chain\n(sequence of blocks). Determining who is allowed to produce a block when, and\nwhat to do in case of conflicts, (such as two participants adding different\nblocks at the same point of the chain), is the purpose of the different\nconsensus protocols.\n\nThe protocol has three main responsibilities:\n\n## About Ouroboros[​](#about-ouroboros \"Direct link to About Ouroboros\")\n\nCardano runs on the Ouroboros consensus protocol, which was delivered with\nseveral peer-reviewed papers presented at top-tier conferences and publications\nin the area of cybersecurity and cryptography. Rather than relying on 'miners'\n(as in proof-of-work protocols) to solve computationally complex equations to\ncreate new blocks – and rewarding the first to do so – proof of stake selects\n[stake pools to create new blocks](/about-cardano/learn/cardano-node#how-does-it-work)\nbased on the stake they control in the network.\n\n## How Ouroboros works[​](#how-ouroboros-works \"Direct link to How Ouroboros works\")\n\nOuroboros divides time on Cardano into epochs where each epoch is divided into\nslots. A slot is a short period of time in which a block can be created.\nGrouping slots into epochs is central to adjusting the leader election process\nto the dynamically changing stake distribution.\n\nCentral to Ouroboros’ design is that it must retain its security in the presence\nof attacks. As such, the protocol has built-in tolerance to prevent attackers\nfrom propagating alternative versions of the blockchain and assumes that an\nadversary may send arbitrary messages to any participant at any time. The\nprotocol is guaranteed to be secure in the so-called synchronous setting (that\nis, with strong guarantees on message delivery times) so long as more than 51%\nof the stake is controlled by honest participants (ie, those following the\nprotocol).\n\nA slot leader is elected for each slot, who is responsible for adding a block to\nthe chain and passing it to the next slot leader. To protect against adversarial\nattempts to subvert the protocol, each new slot leader is required to consider\nthe last few blocks of the received chain as transient: only the chain that\nprecedes the prespecified number of transient blocks is considered settled. This\nis also referred to as the settlement delay. Among other things, this means that\na stakeholder can go offline and still be synced to the blockchain, so long as\nit’s not for more than the settlement delay.\n\nWithin the Ouroboros protocol, each network node stores a copy of the\ntransaction mempool – where transactions are added if they are consistent with\nexisting transactions – and the blockchain. The locally stored blockchain is\nreplaced when the node becomes aware of an alternative, longer valid chain.\n\nRead the following section to learn more about the different types of Ouroboros.\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project.
