        "raw_content": "# Delegation\n\nAs Cardano is a proof of stake (PoS) system, owning ada not only allows you to buy goods or services, but also confers upon you the right and obligation to participate in the protocol and create blocks. Stake delegation is a mechanism inherent in the [Ouroboros protocol](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/889.pdf) that allows the protocol to scale even in a setting where the set of stakeholders might be highly fragmented.\n\nAnyone who owns ada can participate in stake delegation while retaining their spending power. Note that you can spend your ada normally at any time, regardless of how you delegated it. This mechanism will enable stakeholders to participate in the slot leader election process in each epoch.\n\nStake delegation gives rise to *stake pools* that act similarly to mining pools in the Bitcoin protocol. Stake pool operators (SPOs) *must* be online to generate blocks if they are selected as slot leaders.\n\nThere are three options ada holders can consider for delegating their stake:\n\n1. Run their own stake pool\n2. Agree with a third party to run a private stake pool for them\n3. Delegate to other stake pools.\n\nnote\n\nIf you are not familiar with Cardano CLI or stake pool operations, see [delegation tips here.](/about-cardano/new-to-cardano/how-to-delegate)\n\n## Stake delegation requirements[​](#stake-delegation-requirements \"Direct link to Stake delegation requirements\")\n\nDelegating stake requires posting two certificates to the chain: a staking address registration, and a delegation certificate. Posting certificates requires funds, so a user setting up their first wallet will need a bootstrapping mechanism. This mechanism relies on the possibility of base addresses using a [staking key](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-rosetta/tree/master/examples#staking-key-registration-and-delegation) before posting the registration certificate for that key. Note that the stake address can be based either on a single key or on a script such as multi-sig.\n\n## Delegation scheme[​](#delegation-scheme \"Direct link to Delegation scheme\")\n\nWith the concept of delegation, any stakeholder can allow a stake pool to generate blocks for the Cardano network. Then the protocol will distribute the rewards to all participants, including the fees for the SPO. A stakeholder delegates to a particular pool ID, which is the hash of the operator's [verification key](/about-cardano/learn/cardano-keys#vrf-keys).\n\nTo limit the delegate’s block generation power to a certain range of epochs and slots, the stakeholder can limit the proxy signing key’s valid message space to strings ending with a slot number in a specific range of values. This simple scheme is secure due to the verifiability and prevention of misuse properties of proxy signature schemes. This ensures that any stakeholder can verify that a proxy signing key was actually issued by a specific stakeholder to a specific delegate, and that the delegate can only use these keys to sign messages inside the key’s valid message space, respectively.\n\nThe funds belonging to one staking key of a user’s wallet require posting a single transaction, containing a delegation certificate. This will only incur the usual transaction fees. In particular, a stakeholder needs to pay a deposit for registering a stake address and not for the stake delegation itself. Once a stake address is registered, the stakeholder will only pay fees to set the delegation choice.\n\nNote that the stakeholder's stake will count for the pool's stake during the reward calculation.\n\n## Stake delegation scenario[​](#stake-delegation-scenario \"Direct link to Stake delegation scenario\")\n\nImagine a user who is about to receive their first ada, through redemption, from a trade on an exchange, or some other source. They will set up a new wallet, and create an address to receive those funds. This address will be a base address, using a staking key that is generated by the wallet, but not yet registered on the chain.\n\nAfter receiving the initial funds, the user can then participate in staking, by posting a staking key registration certificate, and a delegation certificate for their staking key. Once the key is registered, newly created addresses can be pointer addresses to the staking key registration certificate.\n\ninfo\n\nRelated topics:\n\n* [Operating a stake pool](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/operate-a-stake-pool/)\n* [Advice for stakeholders - delegators and stake pool operators](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/11/13/the-general-perspective-on-staking-in-cardano/)\n\nOn this page\n\n* [Stake delegation requirements](#stake-delegation-requirements)\n* [Delegation scheme](#delegation-scheme)\n* [Stake delegation scenario](#stake-delegation-scenario)\n\n ",

Deep dive into [Cardano's EUTXO accounting model here](https://ucarecdn.com/3da33f2f-73ac-4c9b-844b-f215dcce0628/EUTXOhandbook_for_EC.pdf).\n\nCardano (like Bitcoin) is an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)-based blockchain, which utilizes a different accounting model for its ledger from other account-based blockchains like Ethereum. Cardano implements an innovative [Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTXO) model](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/), which was introduced by the Alonzo upgrade to support multi-assets and smart contracts.\n\n## Overview of the UTXO model[​](#overview-of-the-utxo-model \"Direct link to Overview of the UTXO model\")\n\nIn the UTXO model, a transaction has inputs and outputs, where the inputs are outputs from previous transactions. A transaction can only have previously unspent transaction outputs as its inputs.\n\n### Transaction output[​](#transaction-output \"Direct link to Transaction output\")\n\nA transaction output includes an *address* (that you can think of as a lock) and a *value*. In keeping with this analogy, the signature that belongs to the address is the key to unlock the output. Once unlocked, an output can be used as input. New transactions spend outputs of previous transactions, and produce new outputs that can be consumed by future transactions. Each UTXO can only be consumed once, and as a whole. Each output can be spent by exactly one input, and one input *only*.\n\n### Transaction input[​](#transaction-input \"Direct link to Transaction input\")\n\nA transaction input is the output of a previous transaction. Transaction inputs include a pointer and a cryptographic signature that acts as the unlocking key. The pointer points back to a previous transaction output, and the key unlocks this output. When an output is unlocked by an input, the blockchain marks the unlocked output as 'spent'. New outputs created by a given transaction can then be pointed to by new inputs, and so the chain continues. These new outputs (which have not yet been unlocked, ie, spent) are the UTXOs. Unspent outputs are simply that, outputs that have not yet been spent.\n\nIn summary, transactions consume unspent outputs from previous transactions, and produce new outputs that can be used as inputs for future transactions.\n\nThe users' wallets manage these UTXOs and initiate transactions involving the UTXOs owned by the user. Every node maintains a record of all currently unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs), called the UTXO set. In technical terms, this is the chainstate, which is stored in the data directory of every node. When a new block is added to the chain, the chainstate is updated accordingly. This new block contains the list of latest transactions (including, of course, a record of spent UTXOs, and new ones created since the chainstate was last updated). Every node maintains an exact copy of the chainstate.\n\n## Cardano’s extended UTXO model[​](#cardanos-extended-utxo-model \"Direct link to Cardano’s extended UTXO model\")\n\nThe EUTXO model extends the UTXO model in two ways:\n\n1. It generalizes the concept of ‘address’ by using the lock-and-key analogy. Instead of restricting locks to public keys and keys to signatures, addresses in the EUTXO model can contain arbitrary logic in the form of scripts. For example, when a node validates a transaction, the node determines whether or not the transaction is allowed to use a certain output as an input. The transaction will look up the script provided by the output's address and will execute the script if the transaction can use the output as an input.\n2. The second difference between UTXO and EUTXO is that outputs can carry (almost) arbitrary data in addition to an address and value. This makes scripts much more powerful by allowing them to carry state information.\n\nFurthermore, EUTXO extends the UTXO model by allowing output addresses to contain complex logic to decide which transactions can unlock them, and by adding custom data to all outputs. When validating an address, the script will access the data being carried by the output, the transaction being validated, and some additional pieces of data called redeemers, which the transaction provides for every input. By looking up all this information, the script has enough context to give a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer in what can be highly complex situations and use cases.\n\nEUTXO enables arbitrary logic in the form of scripts. This arbitrary logic inspects the transaction and the data to decide whether the transaction is allowed to use an input or not.\n\nThe UTXO model with its graph structure is fundamentally different from the account-based model used by some existing smart-contract enabled blockchains. As a result, the design patterns that work for DApps on account-based blockchains do not translate directly to Cardano. New design patterns are needed because the underlying representation of the data is different.\n\nEUTXO inherits the per-branches design of the UTXO (Bitcoin) model, where one branch is by definition a sequence of transactions that requires a sequence of validations. To split the logic across different branches and enforce more parallelism, it is essential to build DApps and other solutions using multiple UTXOs. This provides benefits in terms of scaling, just like developing Bitcoin services prerequisites splitting one wallet into sub wallets.\n\n## Advantages of EUTXO[​](#advantages-of-eutxo \"Direct link to Advantages of EUTXO\")\n\nCardano’s EUTXO model provides a secure and versatile environment to process multiple operations without system failures. This model offers better scalability and privacy, as well as more simplified transaction logic, as each UTXO can only be consumed once and as a whole, which makes transaction verification much simpler.\n\nThe EUTXO model offers unique advantages over other accounting models. The success or failure of transaction validation depends only on the transaction itself and its inputs, and not on anything else on the blockchain. As a consequence, the validity of a transaction can be checked off-chain, before the transaction is sent to the blockchain. A transaction can still fail if some other transaction concurrently consumes an input that the transaction is expecting, but if all inputs are still present, the transaction is guaranteed to succeed.\n\nThis contrasts with an account-based model (as used by Ethereum), where a transaction can fail in mid-script execution. This can never happen in EUTXO.\n\nDue to the ‘local’ nature of transaction validation, a high degree of parallelism is possible. A node could, in principle, validate transactions in parallel, if those transactions do not try to consume the same input. This is great both for efficiency and for reasoning, simplifying the analysis of possible outcomes, and proving that ‘nothing bad’ can happen. You can dive deeper into the EUTXO model blog post.\n\nA powerful feature of the EUTXO model is that the fees required for a valid transaction can be predicted precisely prior to posting it. This is a unique feature not found in account-based models. Account-based blockchains, like Ethereum, are indeterministic, which means that they cannot guarantee the transaction’s effect on-chain. This uncertainty presents risks of monetary loss, unexpectedly high fees, and additional opportunities for adversarial behavior.\n\nTo summarize, EUTXO offers greater security, smart contract execution cost predictability (without unpleasant surprises) and more powerful parallelization.\n\nOn this page\n\n* [Overview of the UTXO model](#overview-of-the-utxo-model)\n  + [Transaction output](#transaction-output)\n  + [Transaction input](#transaction-input)\n* [Cardano’s extended UTXO model](#cardanos-extended-utxo-model)\n* [Advantages of EUTXO](#advantages-of-eutxo)",

The word *Ouroboros* itself derives from Ancient Greek, its literal meaning being 'tail eating' or 'tail devourer.'\n\nAs a symbol, Ouroboros represents the infinity of time flowing back unto itself, in a never-ending cycle, as if caught in an eternal loop. Ouroboros first appeared in Egypt, in the 13th century BC. Later, alchemists adopted Ouroboros into their mystical symbolism.\n\nThroughout the ages, Ouroboros has been interpreted and used in a variety of ways by a plethora of cultures. One of the most common interpretations is that the symbol represents the interconnectedness and infinity of the universe.\n\nIn 2017, [Charles Hoskinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Hoskinson) adopted Ouroboros to name the proof-of-stake consensus protocol underlying Cardano. In this context, Ouroboros represents the possibility of infinite and ethical growth and scalability of the blockchain. Ouroboros' central message is the delivery of greater opportunities for the world, and its preservation through [much-reduced energy consumption](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/08/17/why-they-re-calling-cardano-the-green-blockchain/).\n\n## What is Ouroboros[​](#what-is-ouroboros \"Direct link to What is Ouroboros\")\n\n[Ouroboros](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/889.pdf) is the consensus protocol for Cardano, the first provably secure proof-of-stake protocol, and the first blockchain protocol based on peer-reviewed research.\n\nCombining unique technology and mathematically verified mechanisms (including behavioral psychology and economic philosophy principles), Ouroboros guarantees and supports the security and sustainability of any blockchain implementing it. The result is a protocol with proven security guarantees, able to facilitate the propagation of global, permissionless networks with minimal energy requirements. Cardano is the first such network.\n\nOuroboros selects participants - stake pools, in this case - to create new blocks based on the stake they control in the network, and facilitates the creation of distributed, permissionless networks capable of sustainably supporting new markets.\n\n## Ouroboros implementations[​](#ouroboros-implementations \"Direct link to Ouroboros implementations\")\n\nOuroboros comes in different versions:\n\n* [Ouroboros Classic](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroborosa-provably-secure-proof-of-stake-blockchain-protocol/)\n* [Ouroboros BFT](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-bfta-simple-byzantine-fault-tolerant-consensus-protocol/)\n* [Ouroboros Praos](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-praosan-adaptively-securesemi-synchronous-proof-of-stake-protocol/)\n* [Ouroboros Genesis](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-genesiscomposable-proof-of-stake-blockchains-with-dynamic-availability/)\n* [Ouroboros Crypsinous](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-crypsinousprivacy-preserving-proof-of-stake/)\n* [Ouroboros Chronos](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-chronospermissionless-clock-synchronization-via-proof-of-stake/)\n* [Ouroboros Leios](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/high-throughput-permissionless-blockchain-consensus-under-realistic-network-assumptions/).\n\n### Ouroboros Classic[​](#ouroboros-classic \"Direct link to Ouroboros Classic\")\n\nThe first implementation of [Ouroboros](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroborosa-provably-secure-proof-of-stake-blockchain-protocol/) achieved three major milestones:\n\n* the foundation for an energy-efficient protocol to rival proof of work\n* the introduction of the mathematical framework to analyze proof of stake\n* the implementation of a novel incentive mechanism to reward participants in a proof-of-stake setting.\n\nBut what really set Ouroboros apart from other blockchain protocols (specifically, proof-of-stake protocols), was its ability to generate unbiased randomness in the protocol’s leader selection algorithm, and the subsequent security assurances that provided. Randomness prevents the formation of patterns, which is critical for maintaining the protocol’s security. Ouroboros was the first blockchain protocol developed with this type of rigorous security analysis.\n\n### Ouroboros BFT[​](#ouroboros-bft \"Direct link to Ouroboros BFT\")\n\n[Ouroboros Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-bfta-simple-byzantine-fault-tolerant-consensus-protocol/) was the protocol's second implementation, used during the Byron update (transition from the old Cardano codebase to the new). The second instance of the protocol prepared Cardano for the decentralization that came with the Shelley release.\n\nOuroboros BFT enabled synchronous communication between a network of federated servers – the blockchain – providing ledger consensus in a simpler and more deterministic manner.\n\n### Ouroboros Praos[​](#ouroboros-praos \"Direct link to Ouroboros Praos\")\n\n[Ouroboros Praos](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-praosan-adaptively-securesemi-synchronous-proof-of-stake-protocol/) introduced substantial security and scalability improvements to the Ouroboros Classic implementation. Praos processes transaction blocks by dividing chains into slots, which are aggregated into epochs. But unlike Ouroboros Classic, Praos is analyzed in a semi-synchronous setting and is secure against adaptive attackers, using private-leader selection and forward-secure, key-evolving signatures to ensure that a strong adversary cannot predict the next slot leader and launch a focused attack (such as a DDoS attack).\n\n### Ouroboros Genesis[​](#ouroboros-genesis \"Direct link to Ouroboros Genesis\")\n\nThe fourth iteration of Ouroboros - [Genesis](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-genesiscomposable-proof-of-stake-blockchains-with-dynamic-availability/) - further improves upon Ouroboros Praos by adding a novel chain selection rule that enables parties to bootstrap from a genesis block without the need for trusted checkpoints or assumptions about past availability. The Genesis paper also provides proof of the protocol’s Universal Composability, which demonstrates that the protocol can be composed with other protocols in arbitrary configurations in a real-world setting, without losing its security properties.\n\n### Ouroboros Crypsinous[​](#ouroboros-crypsinous \"Direct link to Ouroboros Crypsinous\")\n\n[Ouroboros Crypsinous](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-crypsinousprivacy-preserving-proof-of-stake/) equips Genesis with privacy-preserving properties. It is the first formally analyzed privacy-preserving proof-of-stake blockchain protocol, which achieves security against adaptive attacks while maintaining strong privacy guarantees by introducing a new coin evolution technique relying on Snarks and key-private forward-secure encryption. Crypsinous isn’t currently planned to be implemented on Cardano, but it can be used by other chains for increased privacy-preserving settings.\n\n### Ouroboros Chronos[​](#ouroboros-chronos \"Direct link to Ouroboros Chronos\")\n\n[Chronos](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-chronospermissionless-clock-synchronization-via-proof-of-stake/) achieves two goals: first, it shows how blockchain protocols can synchronize clocks securely via a novel time synchronization mechanism and thereby become independent of external time services. Second, it provides a cryptographically secure source of time to other protocols. In short, Chronos makes the ledger more resistant to attacks that target time information.\n\nFrom an application point of view, Chronos can dramatically boost the resilience of critical telecommunications, transport, and other IT infrastructures that require the synchronization of local time to a unified network clock that has no single point of failure.\n\n### Ouroboros Leios[​](#ouroboros-leios \"Direct link to Ouroboros Leios\")\n\n[Ouroboros Leios](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/high-throughput-permissionless-blockchain-consensus-under-realistic-network-assumptions/), currently in research and development, is the protocol version designed to increase the network's throughput by optimizing the use of available resources and enabling faster transaction processing and confirmation.\n\nLeios is specifically designed to solve scalability bottlenecks in existing systems by acting as a high-throughput overlay on top of base protocols. It tackles malicious actions like protocol bursts (sudden floods of valid messages to congest the network) and equivocations (double-signing attacks), enabling near-optimal transaction processing while preserving security under real-world network constraints.\n\nLearn more about Leios by visiting its [website](https://leios.cardano-scaling.org/docs/overview).\n\nOn this page\n\n* [What is Ouroboros](#what-is-ouroboros)\n* [Ouroboros implementations](#ouroboros-implementations)\n  + [Ouroboros Classic](#ouroboros-classic)\n  + [Ouroboros BFT](#ouroboros-bft)\n  + [Ouroboros Praos](#ouroboros-praos)\n  + [Ouroboros Genesis](#ouroboros-genesis)\n  + [Ouroboros Crypsinous](#ouroboros-crypsinous)\n  + [Ouroboros Chronos](#ouroboros-chronos)\n  + [Ouroboros Leios](#ouroboros-leios)",

When you register a stake pool you can choose to pledge some, or all, of your ada to the pool, to make it more attractive to people who want to delegate. Although pledging is not required when setting up a stake pool, it can make the pool more attractive to delegators, as the higher the amount of ada that is pledged, the higher the rewards that will be paid out. The a0 protocol parameter defines the influence of the pledge on the pool reward.\n\nDistributing rewards[​](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/pledging-rewards#distributing-rewards \"Direct link to Distributing rewards\")\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDuring each epoch, rewards are distributed amongst all stakeholders who have delegated to a stake pool, either to their own stake pool, or another pool. These rewards are auto-generated by the protocol and are not managed by the stake pool operators (SPOs). Rewards come from two sources:\n\n*   All transaction fees: collated from the set of transactions included in a block that was minted during that epoch.\n*   Monetary expansion: involves distinguishing between the total supply of ada and the maximal supply of ada. The total supply consists of all ada currently in circulation, plus the ada in the treasury. The maximal supply is the maximal amount of ada that can ever exist. The difference between these two figures is called the _reserve_. During each epoch, a fixed but parameterizable percentage of the remaining reserve is taken from the reserve and used for epoch rewards and treasury, where the amount being sent to the treasury is a fixed percentage of the amount taken from the reserve.\n\nLearn more about rewards sharing in the [rewards sharing and pledge on Cardano video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAzyN3H8MOA&t=7s).\n\nThe following formula outlines how the reward mechanism works. The available rewards amount, transaction fees, plus monetary expansion, are denoted by R. First, the share of all available rewards that a specific pool can receive is determined, as follows:\n\n![Image 2: pledge_formula](https://docs.cardano.org/assets/images/pledge_formula-6f0c9a8bbfad3923058b99148f970609.png)\n\nThese elements are defined as follows:\n\n*   R - total available rewards for this epoch\n*   a 0 - pledge influence factor (can be between 0 and infinity)\n*   z 0 - relative pool saturation size, i.e. 0.5% based on a number of desired pools (k=200)\n*   σ - stake delegated to the pool (including stake pledged by the owners and stake delegated by others)\n*   σ’ = min(σ, z 0) - as σ, but capped at z 0\n*   s - stake pledged by the owners\n*   s’ = min(s, z 0) - as s, but capped at z 0\n\nNote that z 0, σ and s are all relative, so they are fractions of the total supply, as they all lie between zero and one.\n\nTwo important considerations are:\n\n1.   Rewards increase with σ, but stop increasing once σ reaches z 0, that is once the pool becomes saturated.\n2.   If a 0 (the pledge influence) is zero, this formula simply becomes R·σ’, so it is proportional to the pool's stake, up to the point of saturation. For larger values of a 0, the pledge s becomes more important.\n\nRemember that the pledge is declared during pool registration (alongside the cost and margin values), and has to be honored by the pool owners who are delegating to the pool. If they collectively delegate less than the declared pledge, pool rewards for that epoch will be zero. Note that the pool will be public if its operator margin is set to less than 100%.\n\nThe rewards that are produced by this formula are now adjusted by pool's performance: we multiply by β/σ a, where β is the fraction of all blocks produced by the pool during the epoch and σ a is the stake delegated to the pool relative to the active stake (ie, total stake that is correctly delegated to a non-retired pool).\n\nFor an optimally performing pool (a pool producing all the blocks that it can produce), this factor will be 1, on average. The actual value will fluctuate due to the stochastic nature, or random process of the [Ouroboros Praos](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/573.pdf) consensus algorithm.\n\nAfter pool rewards have been calculated and adjusted for pool performance, they are distributed amongst the pool operator and the pool members, or people who delegated part, or all of their stake, to the pool. This happens in several steps:\n\n*   First, the declared costs are subtracted and given to the pool operator\n*   Next, the declared margin is subtracted and given to the pool operator\n*   Finally, the remainder is split fairly (proportional to delegated stake), amongst all stakeholders who delegated to the pool, including the pool owners.\n\nThe actual amount of ada received in rewards may vary, and will depend on a number of factors including; the actual stake pool performance, that is, the number of blocks a stake pool is observed to produce in a given epoch versus the number it was _expected_ to produce. Changes to network parameters may also affect rewards.\n\n[Previous Delegation](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/delegation)[Next Consensus explained](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/consensus-explained)\n\nOn this page\n*   [Distributing rewards](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/pledging-rewards#distributing-rewards)\n\n![Image 3: Cardano Logo](https://docs.cardano.org/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n\nMore About Cardano\n\n*   [Cardano Explorer](https://cardanoexplorer.com/)\n*   [Cardano Foundation](https://cardanofoundation.org/)\n*   [Cardano.org](https://www.cardano.org/)\n*   [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/)\n\nJoin the community\n\n*   [Cardano Community](https://cardano.org/)\n*   [Cardano Telegram](https://t.me/CardanoAnnouncements/)\n*   [Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/)\n*   [Cardano Blog](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/)\n*   [IOHK](https://www.iohk.io/)\n*   [IOHK blog](https://www.iohk.io/blog/)\n*   [IOHK YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBJ0p9aCW-W82TwNM-z3V2w)\n*   [Cardano Foundation YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbQ9vGfezru1YRI1zDCtTGg)\n*   [Cardano Foundation Twitter](https://twitter.com/Cardano_CF)\n*   [IOG Academy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX9j__vYOJu00iqBrCzecVw)\n\nFollow us\n\n*   [X](https://twitter.com/inputoutputHK)\n*   [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/iohk.io/)\n*   [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/IohkIo)\n*   [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/)\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nEmail* \n\n*   - [x] By checking this box, I agree to allow IOG to store and process the personal data submitted on this form in accordance with the IOG [Privacy Policy](https://static.iohk.io/terms/iog-privacy-policy.pdf)* \n\nCardano is an open-source project.

Stake pools are responsible for processing transactions that will be placed in the ledger, as well as producing new blocks. Stake pools are at the core of [Ouroboros](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/06/03/from-classic-to-chronos-the-implementations-of-ouroboros-explained/), Cardano's proof-of-stake protocol.\n\nTo be secure, Ouroboros requires a good number of stakeholders to be online and maintain sufficiently good network connectivity at any given time. This is why Ouroboros relies on stake pools, entities that are committed to running the protocol 24/7, on behalf of the contributing stakeholders that hold ada. The idea is that these resource holders can bring their resources (their stake) together and form a _pool_, where typically one holder is the operator of the pool and the rest are delegators. Typically, the stake pool operator (SPO) installs and runs software compatible with the platform (the server node), while delegators take a more passive role. They delegate their stake to the pool.\n\nWhile Ouroboros is cheaper to run than a proof-of-work protocol, running Ouroboros still incurs some costs. Therefore, SPOs are rewarded for running the protocol in the form of incentives that come from the transaction fees and inflation of the circulating ada supply.\n\ninfo\n\nFurther reading:\n\n*   [About stake pools, operators, and owners](https://docs.cardano.org/stake-pool-operators/about-stake-pools)\n\n[Previous Cardano nodes](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/cardano-node)[Next Delegation](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/delegation)\n\n![Image 2: Cardano Logo](https://docs.cardano.org/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n\nMore About Cardano\n\n*   [Cardano Explorer](https://cardanoexplorer.com/)\n*   [Cardano Foundation](https://cardanofoundation.org/)\n*   [Cardano.org](https://www.cardano.org/)\n*   [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/)\n\nJoin the community\n\n*   [Cardano Community](https://cardano.org/)\n*   [Cardano Telegram](https://t.me/CardanoAnnouncements/)\n*   [Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/)\n*   [Cardano Blog](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/)\n*   [IOHK](https://www.iohk.io/)\n*   [IOHK blog](https://www.iohk.io/blog/)\n*   [IOHK YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBJ0p9aCW-W82TwNM-z3V2w)\n*   [Cardano Foundation YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbQ9vGfezru1YRI1zDCtTGg)\n*   [Cardano Foundation Twitter](https://twitter.com/Cardano_CF)\n*   [IOG Academy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX9j__vYOJu00iqBrCzecVw)\n\nFollow us\n\n*   [X](https://twitter.com/inputoutputHK)\n*   [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/iohk.io/)\n*   [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/IohkIo)\n*   [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/)\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nEmail* \n\n*   - [x] By checking this box, I agree to allow IOG to store and process the personal data submitted on this form in accordance with the IOG [Privacy Policy](https://static.iohk.io/terms/iog-privacy-policy.pdf)* \n\nCardano is an open-source project.

On Cardano, more than one type of demand competes for the common supply. Thus, it is crucial to consider both _relative_ and _absolute_ pricing. One way to do this is to inspect the effects of smart contract pricing, non-fungible token (NFT) operations, and so on, with respect to some common value – in our case, the consumption of Cardano’s processing power.\n\nThe Cardano ledger's design is focused on high assurance, security, and proven formal verification. In alignment with this strategy, it is also important to ensure that transaction processing is _deterministic_, meaning that a user can predict the impact and outcome of a transaction before its actual execution.\n\nThe ability to guarantee the cost of transaction execution and how the transaction behaves on the ledger _before_ it is submitted became even more prominent with the introduction of smart contract support in 2021. This feature is different from other blockchains, including Ethereum, where other network activity can influence the gas cost. This ability is also guaranteed by the deterministic nature of Cardano and Plutus scripts.\n\nDeterminism[​](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/transaction-costs-determinism#determinism \"Direct link to Determinism\")\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n_Determinism_, in the context of transaction and script processing, is a synonym for predictability. This means that a user can predict locally (off-chain) how their transaction will impact the on-chain state of the ledger, without encountering the following:\n\n*   unexpected script validation outcomes or failures\n*   unexpected fees\n*   unexpected ledger or script state updates.\n\nValidation[​](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/transaction-costs-determinism#validation \"Direct link to Validation\")\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn important aspect of processing a transaction is validating the actions it is taking. A transaction is _taking an action_ when it contains data in the specific field to that action. For example, a transaction is _spending UTXO U_ when it contains a reference to U in its input field, and it is _minting_ a token X when its mint field contains X.\n\nCardano uses scripts to validate actions. These scripts, which are pieces of code, implement pure functions with _True_ or _False_ outputs. _Script validation_ is the process of invoking the script interpreter to run a given script on appropriate arguments.\n\nScript validation can be performed for the following actions:\n\n*   Spending a UTXO locked by a script address: the script that is run is the one whose hash forms the address.\n*   Minting a token: the script that is run is the one whose hash forms the policy ID of the token being minted.\n*   Reward withdrawal: the script that is run is the one whose hash forms the staking address.\n*   Applying a certificate: the script that is run is the one whose hash forms the certificate author’s credential.\n\nBesides letting the node know which script to run, all transaction actions indicate how to assemble arguments passed to that script. Alonzo introduced a new approach to transaction validation on Cardano due to the implementation of Plutus scripts.\n\nLedger features[​](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/transaction-costs-determinism#ledger-features \"Direct link to Ledger features\")\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Alonzo upgrade changed the data on the ledger as follows:\n\n1.   Plutus scripts can lock UTXOs.\n2.   A component, added to the contents of the output parts of UTXOs, enables script state-like functionality. In addition to assets and an address, a UTXO locked by Plutus scripts also contains a datum. A datum is a piece of data that can be thought of as an interpretation of the script state.\n3.   There are a number of protocol parameters used to impose additional validation requirements on transactions. These include upper limits on computational resources that scripts can consume.\n\nTo support Plutus scripts, transactions have the following features:\n\n1.   For each of its actions, the transaction carries a user-specified argument, called a redeemer. Depending on the script, a redeemer can serve a different purpose. For example, it can act as the bid the user places in an auction, or the user’s guess in a guessing game, among many other functions.\n2.   The transaction specifies computational execution budgets for each script.\n3.   To ensure that a transaction can pay its execution fee, Alonzo introduced collateral.\n4.   Transactions contain an integrity hash, needed to ensure that it has not been compromised, outdated, etc.\n\nWith the Vasil upgrade, Plutus scripts were upgraded to V2 functionality with an improved cost model and new built-ins. The use of reference inputs, inline datums, and reference scripts allowed for efficient throughput and significantly increased performance. [See the complete Vasil feature overview here](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/evolution/upgrades/vasil).\n\nThe node performs the checks that ensure the transaction is constructed correctly. For example, it must not exceed the maximum execution resource budget. It also invokes the Plutus script interpreter to run the scripts.\n\nThe non-deterministic gas model can charge users unpredictably large fees. In Cardano scripts, this source of indeterminism is addressed by requiring that the resource budget itself, as well as the fee required to cover this budget, are included in the transaction. Script execution necessarily returns either _True_ or _False_, and will not loop indefinitely. The reason for this is that every operation a script performs takes a non-zero amount of resources, which are tracked by the interpreter. If the budget specified by the transaction is exceeded, script execution terminates and returns _False_.\n\nThe following key points make the outcomes of script and transaction validation **predictable**:\n\n*   the script interpreter will always terminate and return the same validation result when applied to the same arguments\n*   a transaction necessarily fixes all arguments that will be passed to the script interpreter during validation\n*   a transaction specifies all the actions it is taking that require script validation\n*   compulsory signatures on a transaction ensure that it cannot be altered by an adversary in a way that causes scripts to fail\n*   applying a transaction in the EUTXO ledger model is deterministic.\n\nScript validation failure or success does affect how a transaction is processed.

Think of consensus as a ruleset that each\nnetwork participant adheres to. As blockchains are not controlled by any single,\ncentral authority, a consensus protocol is used instead to allow distributed\nnetwork participants to agree on the *history* of the network captured on the\nblockchain – to reach consensus on what has happened, and continue from a single\nsource of truth.\n\nCardano is built on the ground-breaking PoS consensus protocol\n[Ouroboros](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/06/03/from-classic-to-chronos-the-implementations-of-ouroboros-explained/),\nand the first blockchain consensus protocol to be developed through\npeer-reviewed research. At the heart of the protocol are\n[stake pools](/about-cardano/learn/stake-pools), reliable server nodes run by a\nstake pool operator to which ada holders can delegate their stake. Stake pools\nare used to ensure that everyone can participate in the protocol, regardless of\ntechnical experience or availability to keep a node running. These stake pools\nfocus on maintenance and hold the combined stake of various stakeholders in a\nsingle entity.\n\n## How does proof of stake compare to proof of work protocols?[​](#how-does-proof-of-stake-compare-to-proof-of-work-protocols \"Direct link to How does proof of stake compare to proof of work protocols?\")\n\nIn contrast, proof of work (PoW) is a synchronous protocol that encourages\nminers to compete to be the first who can solve any problems within the block. A\nrewards system is used to incentivize this problem-solving. However, this\napproach comes at a cost, with increased electricity usage and longer time spans\nto solve problems within the chain. These factors can slow the network down\nsignificantly and means it is costly to maintain.\n\n## Features of proof of stake[​](#features-of-proof-of-stake \"Direct link to Features of proof of stake\")\n\nOne of the key features of PoS is that as a user's value increases, the\nopportunity to maintain the ledger also increases. This means a higher chance to\nproduce new blocks that can be added to the blockchain and timestamped\naccordingly. The creator of a new block is chosen based on a combination of\nrandom selection and a determination of their stake, or wealth. A type of leader\nelection occurs within the chain. It is worth remembering that within a proof of\nstake protocol, participants accumulate the transaction fees thereby adding to\ntheir wealth as they go. This approach encourages steady and stable growth of\nthe blockchain and reduces the instances of stalled transactions that can\nprevent chain growth.\n\n## Primary advantages of proof of stake[​](#primary-advantages-of-proof-of-stake \"Direct link to Primary advantages of proof of stake\")\n\nSome of the primary advantages of PoS over PoW include:\n\n* rigorous security protocols are incorporated into a PoS protocol\n* reduced centralization - the risk of centralization is reduced by issuing\n  penalties for selfish practices within the network\n* energy efficiency - energy consumption is extremely efficient as a smaller\n  amount of electricity, as well as hardware resources, are needed to produce\n  and run the blockchain\n* cost efficiencies - PoS currencies are far more cost-effective than those\n  operating on PoW protocols.\n\nOn this page\n\n* [How does proof of stake compare to proof of work protocols?](#how-does-proof-of-stake-compare-to-proof-of-work-protocols)\n* [Features of proof of stake](#features-of-proof-of-stake)\n* [Primary advantages of proof of stake](#primary-advantages-of-proof-of-stake)",

        "raw_content": "# What is a blockchain?\n\nA blockchain is a type of database or ledger that is duplicated and distributed to all participants within the blockchain network. It is made up of a set of interconnected nodes that store data or items of value in blocks. These blocks are validated, cryptograhpically secured, and linked to each other in chronological order in a chain. The information stored in the validated blocks of the blockchain cannot be altered later on. It is permanently inscribed in the distributed ledger.\n\nBlockchain technology, otherwise known as distributed ledger technology (DLT), provides a decentralized and accessible data structure for various records. Such records might include financial payment and transaction details, as well as other types of information – from commerce to internet of things (IoT) records.\n\nAs a blockchain stores data in a decentralized manner, it is independent of centralized, controlling entities, or middlemen. This provides enhanced transparency of data storage and its management. An important feature of blockchain is that it stores records immutably, which means that they cannot be changed, forged, or deleted, as this will break the chain of records.\n\nBlockchain can be compared to a book of permanent records, where every page acts as an information holder:\n\nLet’s take a closer look at existing data storage solutions to understand the difference between these systems:\n\n* **Centralized systems** — all data entries and activities are usually managed using one central server. This increases the risk of a single point of failure, and also means that the controlling entity (such as banks or government institutions, for example) act as decision-makers.\n* **Distributed systems** — generally rely on multiple server nodes, each of which serves a subset of the total end clients.\n* **Decentralized systems** — all data and records of transactions are stored not in one server, but in a system of interconnected, independent nodes and terminals. This ensures independence from centralized entities, transparency, and security.\n\nFinally, blockchains not only provide an immutable and secure database but also act as a functional environment to transact funds, create digital currencies, and process complex deals using digital agreements [(smart contracts)](/about-cardano/new-to-cardano/what-is-a-smart-contract).\n\n ",

It is otherwise\ncalled *crypto*.\n\nBlockchain ledgers serve as the underlying technology for cryptocurrency\ncreation in a decentralized environment. Blockchain protocols use rigorous\ncryptography techniques to enable the minting (creation) of cryptocurrency and\nto secure and verify crypto ownership and fund movement records. The price of\ncryptocurrency is not controlled by a government or centralized financial\ninstitution. It is defined by its value, correlation to real-world figures, and\nis driven by market supply and demand.\n\nAddresses are used when sending cryptocurrency payments. They are unique\nidentifiers and are represented by a string of numbers and letters that are\nobtained from the user's public keys.\n\n### Ada is the native currency of Cardano[​](#ada-is-the-native-currency-of-cardano \"Direct link to Ada is the native currency of Cardano\")\n\nEach blockchain ledger has its underlying cryptocurrency or native currency. Ada\nis the native, or principal currency on [Cardano](https://cardano.org/). This\nmeans that ada is the main payment unit on Cardano; it is accepted as\nfee-payment, to make deposits, and is also the only currency in which rewards\nare distributed.\n\nLovelace is the smallest denomination of ada. One ada = 1,000,000 lovelaces. Ada\nhas six decimal places, which makes it easily divisible into smaller fractions.\n\n### Native tokens[​](#native-tokens \"Direct link to Native tokens\")\n\nCardano also supports the creation of native tokens ‒ digital assets that are\ncreated for specific purposes. This means that users, developers, and businesses\ncan use the Cardano blockchain to create tokens that represent a footprint of\nvalue (whether defined by the community, market state, or self-governed entity).\nA token can be fungible (interchangeable) or non-fungible (unique), and act as a\npayment unit, reward, trading asset, or information holder.\n\ninfo\n\nRelated topics:\n\n* [Cardano monetary policy](/about-cardano/explore-more/monetary-policy)\n* [Learn about native tokens](/developer-resources/native-tokens).\n\nOn this page\n\n* [Ada is the native currency of Cardano](#ada-is-the-native-currency-of-cardano)\n* [Native tokens](#native-tokens)",

        "raw_content": "# What is a smart contract?\n\nSmart contracts on Cardano are simple programs often referred to as validator scripts in which users define custom logic. They are automatically executed by each Cardano node validating the transaction when the transaction attempts to move funds from the script's address. The address of each script is derived from the hash-sum of the compiled script.\n\nOnce deployed, smart contracts become immutable, which means they cannot be changed. They are distributable and tamper-proof, fast, and cost-effective, as there is no intermediary, which saves both money and time.\n\n## Tooling and languages[​](#tooling-and-languages \"Direct link to Tooling and languages\")\n\nCardano introduced smart contract support in 2021. As a multi-functional environment, Cardano now supports the development and deployment of smart contracts using different programming languages. Here are some examples:\n\n* [Plutus](https://plutus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) — a purpose-built smart contract development and execution platform. Plutus contracts consist of parts that run on the blockchain (on-chain code) and parts that run on a user’s machine (off-chain or client code). Plutus draws from modern language research to provide a safe, full-stack programming environment based on Haskell, the leading functional programming language.\n* [Marlowe](https://docs.marlowe.iohk.io/docs/introduction) — a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing and executing financial contracts that allows building contracts visually as well as in more traditional code. Financial institutions can use it to develop and deploy custom instruments for their customers and clients, for example. The Marlowe language itself is now embedded in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Haskell offering a choice of editors depending on developers’ preferences and skills.\n* [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org/) - a language and toolchain favoring developer experience. Aiken is used for on-chain validator scripts only.\n* [OpShin](https://github.com/OpShin) - a programming language based on Python for generic smart contracts for Cardano.\n* [plu-ts](https://github.com/HarmonicLabs/plu-ts) - TypeScript-embedded smart contract programming language and a transaction creation library.\n\ninfo\n\nDiscover more ecosystem [builder tools here.](https://developers.cardano.org/tools)\n\nFurther reading and related topics:\n\n* [Developer Portal - smart contracts overview](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/smart-contracts/)\n* [A list of community-built developer tools on Cardano](https://www.essentialcardano.io/article/a-list-of-community-built-developer-tools-on-cardano)\n\nOn this page\n\n* [Tooling and languages](#tooling-and-languages)\n\n ",

The\nsize of the stake is proportional to the amount of ada held. Users who hold a\nstake in Cardano can get passive rewards for validating blocks.\n\nSince not everyone has the time, knowledge, or resources to run a stake pool,\nada holders can delegate their stake to a preferred pool and let an operator\nmaintain their stake on their behalf. This allows everyone to participate in the\nconsensus and get rewards without having to continuously run the node online.\nThe higher the stake in a pool, the more rewards will be assigned to its\nowners.\n\nNote that you can spend your ada at any time, regardless of how you delegated it.\n\nAda holders can delegate their stake using different ecosystem wallets that support this functionality.

Technically, assets are not stored in the wallet ‒\ntheir records live on the blockchain and can be accessed using unique private\nkeys, which grant the right to make transactions. Losing your private keys means\nlosing access to your digital assets.
