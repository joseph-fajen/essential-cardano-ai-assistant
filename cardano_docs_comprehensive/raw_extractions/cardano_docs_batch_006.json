If the stake pool does not produce a block, the slot\nwill remain empty and the blockchain will *not* be extended. The Cardano\nblockchain can tolerate a number of missing blocks, but the majority of blocks\nexpected to be produced (at least 50% + 1) must be generated during an epoch.\n\nAlthough occasionally missed blocks don’t affect the extension of the blockchain\nas a whole, an unresponsive elected stake pool decreases the overall performance\nof the network, which is undesirable.\n\nStake pool performance is calculated according to its expected activity as the\nratio of a number of blocks a stake pool produces in a given epoch versus the\nnumber it was capable to produce. For instance, if the stake pool could produce\n100 blocks (based on its stake and the chance to be elected) in an epoch, but it\nactually produced just 50 blocks, its performance would be 50%.\n\nPoor stake pool performance decreases the number of rewards that a pool and its\nmembers receive, thereby decreasing its attractiveness to delegators. To improve\nits performance, a stake pool should have good network connectivity, be run on a\nreliable system, and actively participate in block production and verification.\n\nThe higher the pool’s performance, the more attractive it will be to delegators\nsince it will offer higher rewards and incentives.\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project.

Stake pools also possess metadata that helps users make a rational choice of a stake pool to delegate to. This metadata is stored off-chain as it might reflect sensitive content, and such an approach allows for a degree of decentralized censorship.\n\nOn the other hand, off-chain metadata storage prerequisites a challenge of open access by different users. On-chain stake pool registrations contain a URL pointer to the off-chain metadata and a content hash that can be fetched from a specific stake pool. This might cause both performance and privacy issues. Another crucial aspect to address is the stake pool’s 'ticker' name, which is the short name a stake pool is recognized by. Ticker names might reflect prominent brands or trademarks which should not be duplicated as this leads to confusion. Stake pool operators (SPOs) running multiple pools might want to use the same metadata for all their pools and then, this might also lead to these pools appearing with the same ticker name.\n\n## Use cases[​](#use-cases \"Direct link to Use cases\")\n\nA stake pool metadata aggregation server (SMASH) is introduced to address metadata performance and privacy issues. Delegators, SPOs, exchanges, or wallets can deploy and use SMASH to ensure a higher level of metadata accountability and maintenance. SMASH aggregates metadata from existing stake pools and provides an efficient way to fetch it and store it in a semi-centralized environment. SMASH operators (exchanges, wallets, SPOs) are then enabled to validate and manage this metadata curating it for censorship via the delisting feature.\n\n## Run your own[​](#run-your-own \"Direct link to Run your own\")\n\nThe first generation of the SMASH server has been deployed by Input Output Global (IOG). It aggregated stake pool metadata and offered a list of valid stake pools with reviewed content and ticker names. Nowadays, various solutions exist to synchronize data from the chain and a SMASH server is provided out-of-the-box as part of the cardano-db-sync project.\n\nFor running your own, see [these Cardano DB Sync instructions](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-db-sync/blob/master/doc/smash.md#smash-characteristics).\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project.

Networking will keep evolving with future\nadditions such as Ouroboros Genesis and peer-sharing. See\n[this explainer](/about-cardano/explore-more/cardano-network/p2p-networking) for\nmore details about network evolution and P2P.\n\nIn a previous hybrid setup, SPOs could configure a node to connect to, for\nexample, 50 other SPO nodes. This is a pretty large number, since many nodes can\nbe offline, change their addresses, etc. While 20 connections are enough for\nefficient communication, SPOs had to over-provision because of the static\nconfiguration.\n\nIn a Dynamic P2P setup, SPOs can target to configure 20 connections, which can\nbe picked from thousands of SPO relays, not just 50. And if any are offline, or\ngo offline, the setup will automatically pick new ones, to meet the set target.\nThis means that the configuration is no longer limited to a static pool of 50\npeers.\n\n## Connecting core and relay nodes[​](#connecting-core-and-relay-nodes \"Direct link to Connecting core and relay nodes\")\n\nAs a stake pool operator, you will have two types of nodes: core nodes and relay\nnodes. Each core node must be accompanied by one or more relay nodes.\n\nThe difference between the two types is that core nodes are responsible for\nproducing blocks, while relays are responsible for communicating with other\nrelays in the network and broadcasting blocks. This difference determines how\nthey are configured and how they are connected to the network.\n\nA core node is configured with various key pairs and an operational certificate\nrequired for block generation. It only connects to its relay nodes.\n\nDeveloper resources:\n\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo-blue.svg)\n![Cardano Logo](/assets/cardano-logo.svg)\n\nCardano is an open-source project.
