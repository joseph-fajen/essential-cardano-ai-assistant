Each era has introduced new functionalities to the network. The upcoming era, Conway, is planned to introduce decentralized governance, implementing [CIP-1694](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-1694) functionality.\n\n| Era | Key features | Consensus | Protocol versions (major/minor) | Hard fork event | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Byron | Proof of stake | Ouroboros Classic PBFT | 0.0 1.0 | Genesis Byron reboot |  |\n| Shelley | Decentralized block production | TPraos | 2.0 | Shelley HF |  |\n| Allegra | Token locking | TPraos | 3.0 | Allegra HF |  |\n| Mary | Native tokens | TPraos | 4.0 | Mary HF |  |\n| Alonzo | Plutus smart contracts | TPraos | 5.0 6.0 | Alonzo HF Alonzo intra-era |  |\n| Babbage | PlutusV2 Reference inputs Inline datums Reference scripts Removal of the \"d\" parameter | Praos | 7.0 8.0 | Vasil Valentine intra-era (SECP) |  |\n| Conway | Decentralized governance | Praos | 9.0 10.0 | Chang HF Bootstrap Full governance |  |\n\nTransitioning from one era to the next is triggered by an **update proposal** that updates the protocol version.\n\n### Byron era update proposals[​](#byron-era-update-proposals \"Direct link to Byron era update proposals\")\n\n![Byron update proposals](/assets/images/upbyron-f2ed5bf108d59bba69571c5fe3b62718.png)\n\n![Byron update proposals](/assets/images/upbyron-f2ed5bf108d59bba69571c5fe3b62718.png)\n\nThe general mechanism for updating protocol parameters in Byron is as follows:\n\nIf there is no stable candidate proposal, then no changes occur. Everything is retained, including a candidate proposal whose threshold-satisfying endorsement was not yet stable and will be adopted in the subsequent epoch unless it gets surpassed in the meantime.\n\nA 'null' update proposal is one that neither increases the protocol version nor the software version. Such update proposals are considered invalid according to the Byron specification.\n\n### Update proposals in Shelley and subsequent eras[​](#update-proposals-in-shelley-and-subsequent-eras \"Direct link to Update proposals in Shelley and subsequent eras\")\n\nThe update mechanism in Shelley is simpler than in Byron. There is no distinction between votes and proposals. To 'vote' for a proposal, a genesis delegate submits the exact same proposal via a regular transaction signed by the delegate key. Additionally, there is no separate endorsement step:\n\n![Shelley update proposals](/assets/images/upshelley-184f27ec16d6bca1caedb3cd1a26bed7.png)\n\n![Shelley update proposals](/assets/images/upshelley-184f27ec16d6bca1caedb3cd1a26bed7.png)\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n\nChanging the values of the protocol parameters and global constants was done via an update proposal.\n\nChanging the values of the global constants always requires a software update, including an increase in the protocol version. An increase in the major version indicates a hard fork, while the minor version indicates a soft fork (meaning old software can validate but not produce new blocks).\n\nOn the other hand, updating protocol parameters can be done without a software update.\n\nBefore the Chang hardfork that brought Cardano to the Conway era, only **genesis delegate key** holders were able to submit and vote on proposals.\n\n## Conway era update proposals[​](#conway-era-update-proposals \"Direct link to Conway era update proposals\")\n\nThe Conway ledger era introduces a new governance framework to Cardano, marking a significant evolution in how decisions about the protocol are made. Building on the foundations laid in previous eras, Conway empowers Cardano with a decentralized governance model where decision-making is accessible to stakeholders. Key features include the introduction of *Delegated Representatives (DReps)*, the *Constitutional Committee*, and an decision making role for *Stake Pool Operators* (SPOs). These entities collaborate through a formalized voting system to vote on governance actions that can be proposed by any ada holder. These governance bodies are in charge of treasury funds, adding or removing members from the constitutional committee, making updates to the Cardano Constitution and changes to protocol parameters. Conway era makes Cardano more resilient and 100% community-driven.\n\nThe process for submitting and voting protocol update proposals undergoes significant changes in the Conway era. First, Genesis delegations and MIR certificates are eliminated. In `DState`, the fields associated with these features are no longer included, and `DelegEnv` no longer contains the fields it had in the Shelley era, effectively rendering the genesis keys obsolete.\n\n`DState`\n`DelegEnv`\n\n### Governance actions[​](#governance-actions \"Direct link to Governance actions\")\n\nIn the Conway ledger era, any ada holder can submit a Governance action, which is the on-chain method to put a proposal to the consideration of the three governance bodies. There are 7 types of governance actions:\n\n| Governance Action | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| NoConfidence | A motion to create a state of no-confidence in the current constitutional committee |\n| UpdateCommittee | Changes to the members of the constitutional committee and/or to its signature threshold and/or terms |\n| NewConstitution | A modification to the off-chain Constitution and/or the proposal policy script |\n| TriggerHF | Triggers a non-backwards compatible upgrade of the network; requires a prior software upgrade |\n| ChangePParams | A change to one or more updatable protocol parameters, excluding changes to major or minor protocol versions (\"hard forks\") |\n| TreasuryWdrl | Movements from the treasury |\n| Info | An action that has no effect on-chain, other than an on-chain record |\n\n### Ratification thresholds[​](#ratification-thresholds \"Direct link to Ratification thresholds\")\n\nEach type of governance action requires meeting a different mix of voting thresholds to be ratified. The table below depicts the thresholds as set on the [Conway genesis file](https://book.world.dev.cardano.org/environments/mainnet/conway-genesis.json):\n\n| Governance action type | CC | DReps | SPOs |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. Motion of no-confidence | - | 0.67 | 0.51 |\n| 2a. Update committee/threshold (*normal state*) | - | 0.67 | 0.51 |\n| 2b. Update committee/threshold (*state of no-confidence*) | - | 0.60 | 0.51 |\n| 3. New Constitution or Guardrails Script | 2/3 | 0.75 | - |\n| 4. Hard-fork initiation | 2/3 | 0.60 | 0.51 |\n| 5a. Protocol parameter changes, network group | 2/3 | 0.67 | - |\n| 5b. Protocol parameter changes, economic group | 2/3 | 0.67 | - |\n| 5c. Protocol parameter changes, technical group | 2/3 | 0.67 | - |\n| 5d. Protocol parameter changes, governance group | 2/3 | 0.75 | - |\n| 6. Treasury withdrawal | 2/3 | 0.67 | - |\n| 7. Info | 2/3 | 1 | 1 |\n\nSome parameters (from different groups) are relevant to security properties of the system. Any proposal attempting to change such a parameter requires an additional\nvote of the SPOs, with the threshold 0.51\n\n`maxBlockBodySize`\n`maxTxSize`\n`maxBlockHeaderSize`\n`maxValueSize`\n`maxBlockExecutionUnits`\n`txFeePerByte`\n`txFeeFixed`\n`utxoCostPerByte`\n`govActionDeposit`\n`minFeeRefScriptCostPerByte`\n\n### Hash Protection[​](#hash-protection \"Direct link to Hash Protection\")\n\n`NoConfidence`, `UpdateCommittee`, `NewConstitution`, `TriggerHF`, and `ChangePParams` actions all require a reference to the last enacted governance action that modified the same state in order to be enacted. Among these, `NoConfidence` and `UpdateCommittee` modify the same state, while the others—`NewConstitution`, `TriggerHF`, and `ChangePParams`—each modify their own independent states. In contrast, `TreasuryWdrl` and `Info` do not require such a reference, as they do not affect the state in conflicting or non-commutative ways. This ensures that the final state after enactment matches the intended state at the time the proposal was submitted, and a proposal's eligibility for enactment may change based on other proposals being enacted.\n\n`NoConfidence`\n`UpdateCommittee`\n`NewConstitution`\n`TriggerHF`\n`ChangePParams`\n`NoConfidence`\n`UpdateCommittee`\n`NewConstitution`\n`TriggerHF`\n`ChangePParams`\n`TreasuryWdrl`\n`Info`\n\n### Votes and Proposals[​](#votes-and-proposals \"Direct link to Votes and Proposals\")\n\n#### Proposals[​](#proposals \"Direct link to Proposals\")\n\nTo propose a governance action, a `Proposal` needs to be submitted in a transaction. Beside the proposed governance action, it requires:\n\n`Proposal`\n`ChangePParams`\n`TreasuryWdrl`\n\n#### Votes[​](#votes \"Direct link to Votes\")\n\nA vote is **Yes**, **No** or **Abstain**, to be cast, a vote must include additional details such as the voter's role (e.g., CC, DRep, or SPO) and their `credential`, along with the specific governance action ID being voted on. Optionally, an anchor may be provided to give context or explain the reasoning behind the vote.\n\n`credential`\n\n### Governance Action lifecycle[​](#governance-action-lifecycle \"Direct link to Governance Action lifecycle\")\n\n![](/assets/images/conwayup-6b55549f06309e9b0957a714402db82e.png)\n\n![](/assets/images/conwayup-6b55549f06309e9b0957a714402db82e.png)\n`TICK`\n`TICK`",
