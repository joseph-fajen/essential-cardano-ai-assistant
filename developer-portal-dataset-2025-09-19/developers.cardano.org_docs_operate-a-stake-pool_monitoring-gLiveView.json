It connects to the locally running node via the specified EKG/Prometheus node endpoints to collect and show node metrics, network information, and other information in real time. The program recognizes whether the node is being used as a relay or a block producer and adjusts the output accordingly.\n\nTo install gLiveView:\n\n`curl -s -o gLiveView.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts/gLiveView.sh  \ncurl -s -o env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts/env`\n`gLiveView.sh`\n`chmod 755 gLiveView.sh`\n\nFor most setups, it's enough to set `CNODE_PORT` in the `env` file.\n\n`CNODE_PORT`\n`env`\n\nDetailed guide and more information can be found on [Guild Operators Page](https://cardano-community.github.io/guild-operators/Scripts/gliveview/)",
