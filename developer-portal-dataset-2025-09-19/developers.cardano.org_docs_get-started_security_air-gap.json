These days it also means there are no radio-based network connections either (WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.).\n\nDevelopers & Cardano stake pool operators generally need an air gap environment in which to work with payment keys, stake pool keys and other cryptocurrency resources that offer high-value targets for hackers.\n\nSome specialised hardware (e.g. hardware wallets) may also perform this function. If you believe you have such a device, please be certain that it offers isolation features for your stake pool or development *and* that you feel secure entrusting your assets to those who have implemented these features.\n\nOtherwise, generally **you need a second computer** to create this air-gapped environment, and the rest of this guide is to help you do that.\n\nIf you don't have an extra computer, or want to try building a standalone Linux environment on a USB drive, [skip to the final section](#option-2-install-your-air-gap-environment-on-a-persistent-usb-drive).\n\n## Option 1: Install your air gap environment on a standalone computer[​](#option-1-install-your-air-gap-environment-on-a-standalone-computer \"Direct link to Option 1: Install your air gap environment on a standalone computer\")\n\n### Choose the right computer[​](#choose-the-right-computer \"Direct link to Choose the right computer\")\n\nYou will get better results from an Intel PC than a Mac:\n\nYou will need this computer's whole disc:\n\nYou can use an older machine, even a *very* old one:\n\n### Confirm Ubuntu as installation OS, or choose differently[​](#confirm-ubuntu-as-installation-os-or-choose-differently \"Direct link to Confirm Ubuntu as installation OS, or choose differently\")\n\nWe choose Ubuntu here because:\n\n`cardano-cli`\n\nThe rest of these instructions will assume the choice of **Ubuntu** for your air gap environment OS. If installing a different variant of Linux, please remember:\n\n### Prepare to follow Ubuntu installation instructions[​](#prepare-to-follow-ubuntu-installation-instructions \"Direct link to Prepare to follow Ubuntu installation instructions\")\n\nRead through the standard Ubuntu installation steps here (external link): [Ubuntu Tutorials > Install Ubuntu desktop](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop)\n\n#### Decide in advance whether to encrypt your air gap machine's files.[​](#decide-in-advance-whether-to-encrypt-your-air-gap-machines-files \"Direct link to Decide in advance whether to encrypt your air gap machine's files.\")\n\nWhen setting up the Ubuntu filesystems, you'll be given the option of creating a Volume Group so it can encrypt your entire partition contents with a variant of the AES algorithm.\n\nYour boot and UEFI partitions might not be encrypted, depending on the type of computer you have & version of the GRUB software with your OS installer.\n\nTherefore, as a precaution, never attach a USB drive to your air gap machine unless you've either formatted the drive or built it as installation media.\n\nThe main advantage to encrypting your air gap system:\n\nThe main disadvantage to encrypting it:\n\n#### (optional, if encrypting your partition) Choose encryption password[​](#optional-if-encrypting-your-partition-choose-encryption-password \"Direct link to (optional, if encrypting your partition) Choose encryption password\")\n\nSuggested password requirements:\n\n### Begin standard Ubuntu installation (with some modifications)[​](#begin-standard-ubuntu-installation-with-some-modifications \"Direct link to Begin standard Ubuntu installation (with some modifications)\")\n\nAs you follow the standard procedure (also linked above), stop at the points in the headings below to ensure you're installing your air gap environment correctly.\n\nBefore starting, there is no need to physically disconnect your chosen air gap machine from the Internet, or do anything to your home router to disable WiFi.\n\nThe Internet will be unconfigured and disconnected after the OS is installed & patched and a small number of initial packages are installed (including the Cardano CLI).\n\n### Follow instructions: [Ubuntu Tutorials > Install Ubuntu desktop](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop)[​](#follow-instructions-ubuntu-tutorials--install-ubuntu-desktop \"Direct link to follow-instructions-ubuntu-tutorials--install-ubuntu-desktop\")\n\n... paying particular attention to these steps:\n\n#### Wireless (if asked)[​](#wireless-if-asked \"Direct link to Wireless (if asked)\")\n\nIf your computer doesn't have a cabled connection, it is acceptable under our security model to add it to the WiFi network during OS installation.\n\n#### Updates and other software[​](#updates-and-other-software \"Direct link to Updates and other software\")\n\n![img](/assets/images/10-software-choices-e4f538c7c5c231af37803b14b80b004c.png)\n\n![img](/assets/images/10-software-choices-e4f538c7c5c231af37803b14b80b004c.png)\n\nSelect **Minimal installation**, since this is the least likely to leave you with security intrusive applications and services.\n\n**Do not select** (as you normally would) the option for **third-party software for graphics and WiFi** because of the potential for institutional spyware.\n\n#### Installation type[​](#installation-type \"Direct link to Installation type\")\n\n![img](/assets/images/20-installation-type-2797b9e575715c5a4a1f23de7d002c0c.png)\n\n![img](/assets/images/20-installation-type-2797b9e575715c5a4a1f23de7d002c0c.png)\n\nTick **Erase disk and install Ubuntu**.... you've already confirmed there's nothing else that needs to be kept on this computer, and that it won't have any other operating systems or working disks.\n\nThe air gap installation should not be a part of any conventional dual-booting environment because of the inevitable security risks that would create.\n\nBefore you hit **Continue**, if you've chosen to encrypt your files:\n\n##### (optional) Set up the hard drive for encryption[​](#optional-set-up-the-hard-drive-for-encryption \"Direct link to (optional) Set up the hard drive for encryption\")\n\n![img](/assets/images/30-encrypt-disk-9a6d62a3770feb4f9f02bb18f02edfb6.png)\n\n![img](/assets/images/30-encrypt-disk-9a6d62a3770feb4f9f02bb18f02edfb6.png)\n\nHit the button below the *Erase disk* option: **Advanced Features** which will at first say *None selected*.\n\nDon’t hit the **Continue** button unless you can verify it now says ***LVM and encryption selected*** under Advanced options:\n\n![img](/assets/images/35-disk-encrypted-c5eb8d41cfc7d25d79d1e8e7315ff5e9.png)\n\n![img](/assets/images/35-disk-encrypted-c5eb8d41cfc7d25d79d1e8e7315ff5e9.png)\n\nEnter the password you have prepared earlier as a **volume decryption key.**\n\n#### Finish & reboot[​](#finish--reboot \"Direct link to Finish & reboot\")\n\nConfirm the installation drive, click **Install now** and **Continue**.\n\nUbuntu will finish installing and then you'll be prompted to remove the installation media & reboot. When rebooting, you will see two things you may never have seen before:\n\nIf you followed these recommendations to only install one single OS on one single disk, the boot menu you see (from [GRUB](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2)) will have only one choice: **Ubuntu**, with the software you just installed, which will be selected by default after a few seconds whenever the system starts.\n\nIf you selected the encryption option for your Ubuntu system, you will need to enter the encryption password every time you start the system.\n\n### Configure Ubuntu according to security recommendations[​](#configure-ubuntu-according-to-security-recommendations \"Direct link to Configure Ubuntu according to security recommendations\")\n\nAt the screen \"Welcome to Ubuntu\" (which new users are currently *forced* to interact with), *refuse **everything*** it offers you:\n\n#### Basic security tightening at command line[​](#basic-security-tightening-at-command-line \"Direct link to Basic security tightening at command line\")\n\n##### Remove packages requiring routine network access:[​](#remove-packages-requiring-routine-network-access \"Direct link to Remove packages requiring routine network access:\")\n\n`sudo apt remove cups  \nsudo apt remove unattended-upgrades`\n\n##### (optional) Remove Snap software subsystem.[​](#optional-remove-snap-software-subsystem \"Direct link to (optional) Remove Snap software subsystem.\")\n\n[Snap](https://snapcraft.io) is questionable for security reasons because (like [AppImage](https://appimage.org) and [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org)) it links application components with libraries that don't have to be compiled from source or security-vetted like the libraries that come with your OS itself.\n\nRemoving Snap is optional because default snaps on the Ubuntu installation media have the same security provenance as the default packages on that same release... yet snaps will also be upgraded in the next part of this procedure, and these upgraded snaps may not be subjected to the same security vetting.\n\nTo proceed with removing Snap, follow these instructions (the exact procedure changes often & these instructions may be the best maintained to date):\n\n#### Update system software & all packages to current time[​](#update-system-software--all-packages-to-current-time \"Direct link to Update system software & all packages to current time\")\n\nThis will upgrade everything on your system from what you received on installation media:\n\n`sudo apt update  \nsudo apt upgrade`\n\n#### Install minimal set of packages for encrypting files/folders & text documents[​](#install-minimal-set-of-packages-for-encrypting-filesfolders--text-documents \"Direct link to Install minimal set of packages for encrypting files/folders & text documents\")\n\n##### (optional) Install LibreOffice[​](#optional-install-libreoffice \"Direct link to (optional) Install LibreOffice\")\n\nThis is recommended because it will give you a means of taking password-encrypted notes that can move between your air gap and computer host environments *in both directions*, so you can:\n\nLibreOffice documents saved with a password are entirely AES-encrypted with a key deriving from that password, which produces arguably the best commercially available security for files & data.\n\nTo install:\n\n`sudo apt install libreoffice`\n\n#### Install encrypting archiver[​](#install-encrypting-archiver \"Direct link to Install encrypting archiver\")\n\nWhether a developer or a stake pool operator, at some point you will also need to encrypt files & folders so they can be extracted on your stake pool or application server, where LibreOffice will generally not run but you can use the installable command `p7zip` instead:\n\n`p7zip`\n`apt install p7zip-full p7zip-rar`\n\nAdding the extra package `p7zip-rar` should make saving files with encryption & compression an option in your file manager (`nautilus`).\n\n`p7zip-rar`\n`nautilus`\n\n#### Install secure deletion tools[​](#install-secure-deletion-tools \"Direct link to Install secure deletion tools\")\n\nYou might need to erase any trace of an unencrypted file that could lead to loss of your funds or Cardano enterprises if it were reconstructed (since ordinary file deletions don't delete data blocks). Therefore you should [install the `secure-delete` tools](https://www.unixmen.com/securely-delete-hard-drive-data-with-secure-delete/) to allow you to zero-write files & their metadata or drive contents & empty disk space:\n\n`secure-delete`\n`apt install secure-delete`\n\n### Reboot again[​](#reboot-again \"Direct link to Reboot again\")\n\nThis confirms that your system will start properly after having updated your system software.\n\n### Install `cardano-cli`[​](#install-cardano-cli \"Direct link to install-cardano-cli\")\n\n`cardano-cli`\n\nUse the standard instructions here at the Developer Portal:\n\nNote this will build `cardano-node` as well as `cardano-cli`, but don't worry: you won't be running a node inside the air gap. 😜\n\n`cardano-node`\n`cardano-cli`\n\n### Unplug from Internet FOREVER[​](#unplug-from-internet-forever \"Direct link to Unplug from Internet FOREVER\")\n\nWe will leave the definition of \"forever\" up to your understanding of Internet threats and whether these can come from OS package repositories, etc., with this in mind:\n\n### Precautions to avoid accidental connection to the Internet[​](#precautions-to-avoid-accidental-connection-to-the-internet \"Direct link to Precautions to avoid accidental connection to the Internet\")\n\n#### BIOS settings: disable WiFi and Ethernet connection[​](#bios-settings-disable-wifi-and-ethernet-connection \"Direct link to BIOS settings: disable WiFi and Ethernet connection\")\n\nSee your computer instructions to review how to get into the BIOS, if you're interested in disabling the network adapters at a very low level so they can't accidentally (or due to a hack) be turned on in software.\n\n#### Put Ubuntu in [Airplane mode](https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/net-wireless-airplane.html)[​](#put-ubuntu-in-airplane-mode \"Direct link to put-ubuntu-in-airplane-mode\")\n\nThis will disable any Bluetooth services as well as WiFi, and shows as an Airplane on Ubuntu & other GNOME desktops as an airplane icon in the upper right corner of the screen.\n\nWith Airplane Mode always engaged, you would need the obvious Internet cable plugged in to have any network access (unlike WiFi which can often be connected by accident).\n\n#### Add your computer's WiFi MAC address to the blacklist on your Internet router[​](#add-your-computers-wifi-mac-address-to-the-blacklist-on-your-internet-router \"Direct link to Add your computer's WiFi MAC address to the blacklist on your Internet router\")\n\nSome routers maintain a list of MAC addresses which will not be given an IP address by DHCP, which isolates them from the Internet unless that network interface is configured manually.\n\nTherefore, you can [find your WiFi MAC address](https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/net-macaddress.html.en) and add it to your router's blacklist: usually in its DNS, DHCP, or LAN settings.\n\n### Congratulations, your air gap environment is complete![​](#congratulations-your-air-gap-environment-is-complete \"Direct link to Congratulations, your air gap environment is complete!\")\n\nYou now have a safe place you can use for your [Secure Transaction Workflow](/docs/get-started/security/secure-workflow).\n\n## Option 2: Install your air gap environment on a persistent USB drive[​](#option-2-install-your-air-gap-environment-on-a-persistent-usb-drive \"Direct link to Option 2: Install your air gap environment on a persistent USB drive\")\n\nLinux veterans only! (otherwise please [follow option 1](#option-1-install-your-air-gap-environment-on-a-standalone-computer))\n\nThis option may suit more demanding users, especially those:\n\nIf this appeals to you, and you don't mind following a more complicated and error-prone installation procedure, you might want to install the air gap environment on a bootable USB drive instead. You can then boot a computer from this drive to have access to your secure resources and `cardano-cli` while isolating that computer from the Internet as well as any malicious software that might be installed on that computer.\n\n`cardano-cli`\n\nThis loosely documented configuration has been called the **Frankenwallet**, with separate instructions at these links which mostly follow the procedure above:\n\nThese instructions may be difficult or unsafe to follow unless you have experience with \"dual boot\" Linux installations and other custom OS & booting configurations.\n\n`cardano-cli`",
