With it you can safely perform all tests free of charge - the reason why you want to develop on the testnets.\n\nTo get free test ada for Preprod or Preview, you need to visit: [Cardano Testnet Faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnets/tools/faucet)\n\n### Which block explorers can I use for the Cardano testnets?[​](#which-block-explorers-can-i-use-for-the-cardano-testnets \"Direct link to Which block explorers can I use for the Cardano testnets?\")",
