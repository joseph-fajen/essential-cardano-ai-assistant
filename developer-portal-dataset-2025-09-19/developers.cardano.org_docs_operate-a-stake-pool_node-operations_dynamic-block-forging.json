However, with the introduction of peer-to-peer (P2P) nodes, the previous approach\nof using firewall rules to prevent relays from connecting to the backup node, and thus\nstop duplicate blocks from being propagated, will no longer be effective.\n\nIn the P2P environment, relays can repurpose inbound connections from the block producer,\nleading to potential complications. To address this issue, we've introduced a way for a\nblock producing node to be started (and stopped) without immediately producing blocks. It\nwill only begin (or stop) block production when it receives a SIGHUP signal.\n\n## Enabling and Disabling Block Forging[​](#enabling-and-disabling-block-forging \"Direct link to Enabling and Disabling Block Forging\")\n\nBlock Forging can be toggled on and off using the SIGHUP signal. Sending such a signal\ntriggers the node to read the block forging credential files. Note that this will also\ntrigger the re-reading of the topology configuration file, so connections might be lost.\n\nAs these credential files are provided through CLI flags, they cannot be removed without\nrestarting the node. To disable block forging, you need to move, rename, or delete the\nfile at the specified path (for the credential flags), and then send the SIGHUP signal.\nThe code will then recognize that the specified files are missing and disable block\nforging, recording the appropriate log messages.\n\n## Starting as a Non-Producing Node[​](#starting-as-a-non-producing-node \"Direct link to Starting as a Non-Producing Node\")\n\nIf you wish to start a block producing node (i.e., passing the credentials in the\nrespective flags) without it acting as a block producer immediately, you can use the\n`--start-as-non-producing-node` flag. This will run the node with credentials as a\nstandard node. However, upon receiving the SIGHUP signal, it will read the credential\nfiles and start block forging.\n\n`--start-as-non-producing-node`\n\nThis configuration allows for safer management of block production in a P2P environment,\nreducing the risk of duplicate blocks and improving overall network stability.",
