From grassroots innovation to large-scale infrastructure, find the right funding path for your project.\n\n## Funding Options[​](#funding-options \"Direct link to Funding Options\")\n\n### Project Catalyst[​](#project-catalyst \"Direct link to Project Catalyst\")\n\nProject Catalyst is one of the world's largest decentralized grant programs, having distributed over **+$150M** across **+2000** funded proposals through community voting.\n\nVisit the official [Project Catalyst website](https://projectcatalyst.io/) to explore current funding opportunities and active campaigns.\n\n#### How It Works[​](#how-it-works \"Direct link to How It Works\")\n\nProject Catalyst operates in three phases:\n\nCommunity responds to challenges with ideas. Brainstorming leads to conceptualization, feedback, and finalized proposals.\n\nParticipants vote on proposals they wish to see funded.\n\nSelected projects receive milestone-based funding with community reviewer feedback loop and progress reports.\n\n#### How to Participate[​](#how-to-participate \"Direct link to How to Participate\")\n\n| Role | What You Do | How to Get Started |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Proposers** | Submit innovative ideas for community funding | Create account on [Project Catalyst platform](https://projectcatalyst.io/) during active campaigns |\n| **Community Reviewers** | Evaluate and provide feedback on proposals | Join as incentivized reviewer to ensure proposal quality |\n| **Voters (Ada Holders)** | Decide which proposals receive funding | Download Catalyst app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/kg/app/catalyst-voting/id1517473397) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.iohk.vitvoting&gl=US)) |\n| **Milestone Reviewers** | Track funded project progress and deliverables | Review Statement of Milestones and Proof of Achievement as incentivized role |\n\n#### Why Participate?[​](#why-participate \"Direct link to Why Participate?\")\n\n#### Resources[​](#resources \"Direct link to Resources\")\n\n### Cardano Builder DAO[​](#cardano-builder-dao \"Direct link to Cardano Builder DAO\")\n\n**Cardano Builder DAO** is a smart contract-governed funding mechanism that supports high-potential projects with demonstrated traction and measurable impact.\n\n**When to Consider:**\n\nLearn more at [Cardano Builder DAO](https://buildingoncardano.io/).\n\n### Treasury Withdrawals[​](#treasury-withdrawals \"Direct link to Treasury Withdrawals\")\n\nFor mature projects with proven impact, Cardano's on-chain governance enables **Treasury withdrawals**. Ada funding proposals voted on by the community.\n\n**When to Consider:**\n\nAnyone can submit treasury withdrawal proposals, which require approval from **DReps** (Delegated Representatives) and the **Constitutional Committee** through Cardano's governance system. Organizations like [Intersect](https://www.intersectmbo.org/) and [PRAGMA](https://pragma.builders) can serve as administrators to help coordinate due diligence, contracting, and disbursements for approved proposals.\n\nLearn more about [Treasury withdrawals](/docs/governance/cardano-governance/governance-actions).\n\n## Your Funding Journey[​](#your-funding-journey \"Direct link to Your Funding Journey\")\n\nCardano's funding ecosystem creates a natural progression for projects.
