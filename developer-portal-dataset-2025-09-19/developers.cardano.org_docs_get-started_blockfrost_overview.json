The service is public and freely accessible, making it the perfect alternative to running and maintaining your own infrastructure and tools.\n\nIn addition to the Cardano networks, it also provides access to IPFS and Milkomeda.\n\nThe core technology of Blockfrost is [open-source](https://github.com/blockfrost/blockfrost-backend-ryo), and its development is supported by the collaborative efforts of the Cardano community.\n\nFind out more details on how to build with Blockfrost at [Blockfrost Development Hub](https://blockfrost.dev/).",
