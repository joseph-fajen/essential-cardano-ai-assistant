Use `nvm use 18` if you have multiple versions.\n\n`[ERROR] Minimum Node.js version not met`\n`nvm use 18`\n\n### Sidebars loading error[​](#sidebars-loading-error \"Direct link to Sidebars loading error\")\n\n**Problem:** `[ERROR] Sidebars file failed to be loaded`  \n**Solution:** Run `yarn build` first - this pulls missing auto-generated files.\n\n`[ERROR] Sidebars file failed to be loaded`\n`yarn build`\n\n### Token Registry error[​](#token-registry-error \"Direct link to Token Registry error\")\n\n**Problem:** `[ERROR] Sidebar category Token Registry has no subitem`  \n**Solution:** Run `yarn build` first - same as above.\n\n`[ERROR] Sidebar category Token Registry has no subitem`\n`yarn build`\n\n## FAQ[​](#faq \"Direct link to FAQ\")\n\n**Q: Should I commit yarn.lock changes?**  \nA: No, never commit `yarn.lock` changes. This file is managed by maintainers.\n\n`yarn.lock`\n\n**Q: How to ensure my PR won't break?**  \nA: Always run `yarn build` successfully before submitting. It catches more issues than `yarn start`.\n\n`yarn build`\n`yarn start`\n\n**Q: How do I fix committed yarn.lock?**  \nA: Remove it with: `git checkout staging -- yarn.lock && git commit -m 'revert yarn.lock'`\n\n`git checkout staging -- yarn.lock && git commit -m 'revert yarn.lock'`\n\n## Review Process[​](#review-process \"Direct link to Review Process\")\n\n## Getting Help[​](#getting-help \"Direct link to Getting Help\")\n\n## Why Contribute to the Developer Portal?[​](#why-contribute-to-the-developer-portal \"Direct link to Why Contribute to the Developer Portal?\")\n\nWe wanted to build a developer portal as open and inclusive as Cardano. A portal that is in the hands of the Cardano community and can be constantly evolved by it.\n\n### Build Your Reputation[​](#build-your-reputation \"Direct link to Build Your Reputation\")\n\nContributions to the developer portal will give your GitHub name and profile higher visibility as more and more people come across your work online. As visibility increases, so too will the reputation of your name and brand.\n\n### Build Your Confidence[​](#build-your-confidence \"Direct link to Build Your Confidence\")\n\nCreating tutorials and showing fellow community members how to create will not only elevate your knowledge of your own skills and processes, but will also bestow you with greater confidence in your abilities as you interact with others.\n\nSince everything is public, people typically pay greater attention to how well something is written or programmed. This will afford you with an invaluable set of eyes on your contributions that will serve as a crucial peer-reviewed tool to catch errors and refine your work.\n\n### Build Your Resume[​](#build-your-resume \"Direct link to Build Your Resume\")\n\nEach contribution you make acts as a precious notch on your belt towards career development or job searches within the Cardano ecosystem. It is also a way for people to find examples of your work and verify your abilities. By contributing to open source projects, you will not only gain a lot of valuable experience, but if your profile reaches a certain level of attention and recognition, you are also more likely to get professional opportunities further down the line.\n\n## More Ways to Contribute[​](#more-ways-to-contribute \"Direct link to More Ways to Contribute\")\n\n### Spread the Word[​](#spread-the-word \"Direct link to Spread the Word\")\n\nOften underestimated: spread the word. For example: if someone asks you for Cardano wallets, link to the [wallet showcase](https://developers.cardano.org/showcase?tags=wallet). If they want to know about Cardano block explorers, link to the [block explorer showcase](https://developers.cardano.org/showcase?tags=explorer).\n\n### Create Issues[​](#create-issues \"Direct link to Create Issues\")\n\nCreating an issue is the first step to improving the portal. You don't even have to do the improvement yourself. You can think of it as creating a topic in a forum.\n\nAn \"issue\" can be anything from a simple suggestion to a fully elaborated plan with many sub-items and tasks to check off. You can also open an issue to discuss things. Like a public task manager, people can assign tasks to themselves. [Create an issue now](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/developer-portal/issues)\n\nIf creating an issue in GitHub is too much for you, please consider opening a topic [on the Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/c/developers/29) with a title like \"Developer Portal Suggestion: your suggestion\".\n\n### Improve Text Content[​](#improve-text-content \"Direct link to Improve Text Content\")\n\nFix typos and improve texts, especially if you are a native speaker and have strong writing skills.\n\n### Create Graphics[​](#create-graphics \"Direct link to Create Graphics\")\n\nIf you are a talented graphic designer, you can improve various charts and diagrams. We should always use graphics that work well in both light mode and dark mode for the portal. You can also make one graphic for each.\n\n### Participate in Discussions[​](#participate-in-discussions \"Direct link to Participate in Discussions\")\n\nIf you think something is wrong or something fundamental should change, discussions are the appropriate start to find consensus. There are always [ongoing discussions](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/developer-portal/discussions) on how to handle or improve something. Please take part in them. Even if you are not a developer, your views are valuable.\n\n### Review Pull Requests[​](#review-pull-requests \"Direct link to Review Pull Requests\")\n\nIf you have excellent technical understanding and mistakes catch your eye, you can review pull requests. You should have made contributions before and have a GitHub account with some reputation. [If you are unsure, just participate in the discussions.](#participate-in-discussions)\n\n## Community Connection[​](#community-connection \"Direct link to Community Connection\")\n\n### How to Connect with the Developer Community[​](#how-to-connect-with-the-developer-community \"Direct link to How to Connect with the Developer Community\")\n\nCardano developers and stake pool operators spread across many different platforms. [We aim to provide a complete overview.](/docs/get-started/cardano-developer-community)\n\nIf you are interested in connecting with people from the Developer Portal, [open a thread in the forum](https://forum.cardano.org/c/developers/29).\n\n### Review Process Details[​](#review-process-details \"Direct link to Review Process Details\")\n\nPull requests must be approved by **three reviewers** to be merged. They are always merged into the **staging branch** first. [staging-dev-portal.netlify.app](https://staging-dev-portal.netlify.app) reflects the state of the current staging branch.\n\nLater, the changes are pushed from staging to the main branch. This requires another pull request. (For this reason, there is always a small delay between staging and production).",
