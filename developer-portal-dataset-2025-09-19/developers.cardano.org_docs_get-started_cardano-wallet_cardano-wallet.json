This component provides a [CLI (Command Line Interface)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) and [Web API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API) for creating multiple **Cardano** wallets, sending transactions, getting transaction history details, wallet balances and more!\n\n`cardano-wallet`\n\nIf you want to avoid compiling the binaries yourself, you can download the latest pre-built binaries from the GitHub repository: [`cardano-wallet` Releases](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-wallet/releases)\n\n`cardano-wallet`\n\nThis guide assumes you have installed `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` into your system. If not you can refer to [Installing cardano-node](/docs/operate-a-stake-pool/node-operations/installing-cardano-node) guide for instructions on how to do that.\n\n`cardano-node`\n`cardano-cli`\n\nYou must connect your `cardano-node` to a [testnet network](/docs/get-started/testnets-and-devnets) and make sure it is fully synchronized. If you are not sure how to do that, It is recommended to read [Running cardano-node](/docs/operate-a-stake-pool/node-operations/running-cardano) guide before proceeding.\n\n`cardano-node`\n\n### Choose your Platform[â€‹](#choose-your-platform \"Direct link to Choose your Platform\")\n\n## MacOS / Linux[â€‹](#macos--linux \"Direct link to MacOS / Linux\")\n\nIn this section, we will walk you through the process of downloading, compiling and installing `cardano-wallet` into your **Linux / MacOS** based operating system.\n\n`cardano-wallet`\n\n#### Downloading & Compiling[â€‹](#downloading--compiling \"Direct link to Downloading & Compiling\")\n\nWe need to install cabal, if we don't have it. See the following link for instructions: <https://www.haskell.org/cabal/>\n\nIf you have followed the [Installing cardano-node](/docs/operate-a-stake-pool/node-operations/installing-cardano-node) guide, You should have the `$HOME/cardano-src` directory. If not, let's create a working directory to store the source-code and build for `cardano-wallet`.\n\n`$HOME/cardano-src`\n`cardano-wallet`\n`mkdir -p $HOME/cardano-src  \ncd $HOME/cardano-src`\n\nNext we download the `cardano-wallet` source-code:\n\n`cardano-wallet`\n`git clone https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-wallet.git   \ncd ./cardano-wallet/`\n\nSwitch the repository to the latest tagged commit:\n\n`TAG=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0) && echo latest tag $TAG   \ngit checkout $TAG`\n\nYou can check the latest available version / tag by visiting the `cardano-wallet` [Github Release](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-wallet/releases) page. At the time of writing this, the current version is `v2021-11-11`. You can list all tags also with `git tag -l` command.\n\n`cardano-wallet`\n`v2021-11-11`\n`git tag -l`\n\n#### Building and installing the node[â€‹](#building-and-installing-the-node \"Direct link to Building and installing the node\")\n\nWe can now build `cardano-wallet` code to produce executable binaries.\n\n`cardano-wallet`\n`cabal build all`\n\nInstall the newly built `cardano-wallet` binary to the `$HOME/.local/bin` directory:\n\n`cardano-wallet`\n`$HOME/.local/bin`\n`cabal install cardano-wallet`\n\nCheck the version that has been installed:\n\n`cardano-wallet version`\n\nYou should see something like this:\n\n`v2021-11-11 (git revision: dac16ba7e3bf64bf5474497656932fd342c3b720)`\n\nCongratulations, you have successfully installed `cardano-wallet` into your Linux/MacOS system! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰\n\n`cardano-wallet`\n\n## Windows[â€‹](#windows \"Direct link to Windows\")\n\nCurrently, the **Windows** installation guide is still in-progress. In the meantime we recommend using [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) to get a Linux environment on-top of Windows. Once you have that installed you can use the [Linux](#macos--linux) guide to install and run `cardano-node` within **WSL**.\n\n`cardano-node`\n\nOptionally, you can download the latest precompiled Windows binary from the GitHub repository: [`cardano-wallet` Releases](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-wallet/releases)\n\n`cardano-wallet`",
