Its purpose is to ensure smooth transitions, continuity, and a consistently high standard of constitutional assessment for on-chain governance actions.\n\n## Understanding the Role[​](#understanding-the-role \"Direct link to Understanding the Role\")\n\n### Introduction to the Constitutional Committee[​](#introduction-to-the-constitutional-committee \"Direct link to Introduction to the Constitutional Committee\")\n\nThe [Constitutional Committee](/docs/governance/cardano-governance/governance-model#cc) is a core component of Cardano's governance framework. Its primary mandate is to ensure the integrity of the ecosystem by assessing whether on-chain governance actions are compliant with the [Cardano Constitution](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md).\n\nThe CC does not judge the *merit* or *wisdom* of a proposal; it acts as a technical guardian, confirming that governance actions adhere to the established rules in parallel with the community-wide vote by ada holders.\n\n### Core Responsibilities & Required Skills[​](#core-responsibilities--required-skills \"Direct link to Core Responsibilities & Required Skills\")\n\nThe central function of a CC member is to review, vote on, and provide rationales for governance actions.\n\n**Core Responsibilities:**\n\n**Required Skills:**\n\nA successful CC member or team should possess a blend of:\n\n## Establishing Your Presence[​](#establishing-your-presence \"Direct link to Establishing Your Presence\")\n\n### Structuring Your Committee (Individual, Consortium, etc.)[​](#structuring-your-committee-individual-consortium-etc \"Direct link to Structuring Your Committee (Individual, Consortium, etc.)\")\n\nCC members can be individuals, groups, or formal organizations. On-chain, each CC member is represented by a credential. The structure you choose will define your operational model.\n\n### Internal Governance Models & Best Practices[​](#internal-governance-models--best-practices \"Direct link to Internal Governance Models & Best Practices\")\n\nA transparent and documented internal decision-making process is crucial for legitimacy.\n\n### Legal and Operational Considerations[​](#legal-and-operational-considerations \"Direct link to Legal and Operational Considerations\")\n\nWhile Cardano governance operates on-chain, CC members operate in the real world. Deciding on a legal structure for your participation is a critical step, especially for consortia or those treating the role as a professional commitment.\n\n**Why Consider a Formal Legal Structure?**\n\n**Common Structures:**\n\nThe appropriate legal entity depends heavily on your jurisdiction and goals. Standard options include a Limited Liability Company (LLC), a non-profit organization, or a foundation.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is for educational purposes only and does not constitute legal or financial advice. The Cardano ecosystem does not mandate any specific legal structure. Please consult with qualified legal and tax professionals in your local jurisdiction to determine the best approach for your particular situation.\n\n## The Governance & Technical Workflow[​](#the-governance--technical-workflow \"Direct link to The Governance & Technical Workflow\")\n\n### The Path to Membership: Election via Governance Action[​](#the-path-to-membership-election-via-governance-action \"Direct link to The Path to Membership: Election via Governance Action\")\n\nBecoming a member of the Constitutional Committee is a formal on-chain governance process that requires election by the Cardano community. You cannot unilaterally become a member.\n\nThe process is as follows:\n\n**Submit a Governance Action:** A proposal to modify the committee must be submitted to the blockchain. This is the [\"Update committee/threshold\"](/docs/governance/cardano-governance/governance-actions#detailed-technical-breakdown) governance action. Any ada holder can use this action to add or remove members, change their terms, or adjust the voting threshold required for the committee itself.\n\n**Community Ratification:** For the governance action to pass, it must be approved by both DReps and SPOs. The exact voting threshold required depends on the current state of the Constitutional Committee (normal vs. no-confidence). These thresholds are defined by updatable protocol parameters.\n\n| Category | Normal State | No-Confidence State |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| DRep Approval Thresholds | 67% | 60% |\n| SPO Approval Thresholds | 51% | 51% |\n\n**Activation:** Once ratified by both groups according to the required thresholds, the change to the committee is enacted on-chain. Only then are the new members officially part of the Constitutional Committee and able to vote.\n\nThis process ensures that the community, through its elected representatives, has the final say on who safeguards the Constitution.\n\n### Registering Your Approved Credential[​](#registering-your-approved-credential \"Direct link to Registering Your Approved Credential\")\n\nThe tools below are used to generate the credential hash that you include in the Update committee governance action. After a successful election, these tools are used to manage the keys associated with that credential to sign votes.\n\n### Testing on SanchoNet[​](#testing-on-sanchonet \"Direct link to Testing on SanchoNet\")\n\nBefore engaging in the mainnet governance process, it is advisable to test your entire technical workflow on a dedicated governance testnet, such as [SanchoNet](https://sancho.network/).\n\n**Testing Checklist:**\n\n### How to Vote On-Chain[​](#how-to-vote-on-chain \"Direct link to How to Vote On-Chain\")\n\nOnce you are an active member of the CC, a vote is a transaction submitted to the blockchain that references a specific governance action. Your CC hot key must sign this transaction.\n\nThe cornerstone of transparent voting is publishing a clear rationale for your decision and linking it to your on-chain vote. The best practices for creating and publishing these rationales are detailed [below](#publishing-rationales--community-engagement).\n\n**Examples of Voting Rationales:**\n\n## Assessment & Communication[​](#assessment--communication \"Direct link to Assessment & Communication\")\n\n### The Assessment Workflow & Checklist[​](#the-assessment-workflow--checklist \"Direct link to The Assessment Workflow & Checklist\")\n\nA structured governance action assessment process ensures consistency and thoroughness.\n\n**Sample Workflow:**\n\n**Constitutional Assessment Checklist:**\n\n### Publishing Rationales & Community Engagement[​](#publishing-rationales--community-engagement \"Direct link to Publishing Rationales & Community Engagement\")\n\nTransparency is the foundation of trust. The community standard for achieving this is to publish a detailed rationale for your vote and link it immutably from the voting transaction itself, as outlined in [CIP-0136](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-0136).\n\n**Best Practice for Rationale Publication:**\n\n**Community Engagement:**\n\nAfter voting, use platforms like [X (Twitter)](https://x.com) or the [Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/c/governance/constitutional-committee/213) to announce your decision and link to your published rationale (e.g., the GitHub version for easy readability). This helps inform the broader community and fosters discussion.\n\n## Mentorship & Succession Planning[​](#mentorship--succession-planning \"Direct link to Mentorship & Succession Planning\")\n\nTo ensure the long-term health and stability of the committee, a smooth transition between outgoing and incoming members is essential. A key part of this is active mentorship from the outgoing member.\n\n**Recommendations for Outgoing Members:**\n\n## New Member Quick-Start Checklist[​](#new-member-quick-start-checklist \"Direct link to New Member Quick-Start Checklist\")",
