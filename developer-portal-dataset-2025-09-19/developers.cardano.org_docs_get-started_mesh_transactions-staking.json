If you are new to transactions, be sure to check out how to create transactions to [send lovelace and assets](/docs/get-started/mesh/transactions-basic).\n\nIn this section, we will explore the following:\n\n## Register Stake Address[​](#register-stake-address \"Direct link to Register Stake Address\")\n\nNew address must \"register\" before they can delegate to stake pools.\n\n`import { Transaction } from \"@meshsdk/core\";  \n  \nconst rewardAddress = \"stake1qdzmqvfdnxsn4a3hd57x435madswynt4hqw8n7f2pdq05g4995re\";  \nconst poolId = \"pool1mhww3q6d7qssj5j2add05r7cyr7znyswe2g6vd23anpx5sh6z8d\";  \n  \nconst tx = new Transaction({ initiator: wallet });  \ntx.registerStake(rewardAddress);  \ntx.delegateStake(rewardAddress, poolId);  \n  \nconst unsignedTx = await tx.build();  \nconst signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);  \nconst txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);`\n\n## Delegate ADA to Stake pool[​](#delegate-ada-to-stake-pool \"Direct link to Delegate ADA to Stake pool\")\n\nDelegation is the process by which ADA holders delegate the stake associated with their ADA to a stake pool. Doing so, this allows ADA holders to participate in the network and be rewarded in proportion to the amount of stake delegated.\n\n`import { Transaction } from \"@meshsdk/core\";  \n  \nconst rewardAddress = \"stake1qdzmqvfdnxsn4a3hd57x435madswynt4hqw8n7f2pdq05g4995re\";  \nconst poolId = \"pool1mhww3q6d7qssj5j2add05r7cyr7znyswe2g6vd23anpx5sh6z8d\";  \n  \nconst tx = new Transaction({ initiator: wallet });  \ntx.delegateStake(rewardAddress, poolId);  \n  \nconst unsignedTx = await tx.build();  \nconst signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);  \nconst txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);`\n\nCheck out the [Mesh Playground](https://meshjs.dev/apis/transaction/staking) for live demo and full explanation.",
