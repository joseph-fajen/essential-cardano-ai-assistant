It covers everything from preparation and metadata creation to best practices and final submission.\n\n## Introduction[​](#introduction \"Direct link to Introduction\")\n\nCardano's governance is decentralized and permissionless, any ada holder can propose changes. Governance actions are the mechanism for enacting these changes, and they are voted on by at least two of the three governance bodies: **Delegated Representatives** (DReps), the **Constitutional Committee** (CC), and **Stake Pool Operators** (SPOs). 'Enactment' refers to the point at which a governance action, having passed all necessary votes and checks, is implemented on the Cardano blockchain, and its proposed changes take effect. This guide will walk you through the steps necessary to successfully submit a governance action.\n\n## Understanding Governance Actions[​](#understanding-governance-actions \"Direct link to Understanding Governance Actions\")\n\nGovernance actions are formal proposals submitted on-chain. They aim to modify aspects of the Cardano blockchain. Each governance action requires a refundable deposit of 100,000 ada (as of March 2025). The deposit is returned if your action is enacted or expires without being enacted.\n\nThere are seven types of governance actions:\n\nOf these, the first six have direct on-chain effects if approved. The \"Info\" action is used for signaling and does not directly change the chain's state. More details about all types can be found on the [Governance Action](/docs/governance/cardano-governance/governance-actions) page.\n\nGovernance actions require approval from at least two of three governance bodies and, in some cases, from all three, the specific details can be reviewed in [CIP-1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-1694#requirements).\n\n## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites \"Direct link to Prerequisites\")\n\nBefore submitting a governance action, you *should* complete the following:\n\n## Optionally, authors can consider socialising their idea for a governance action before submission, giving stakeholders time to provide feedback.[​](#optionally-authors-can-consider-socialising-their-idea-for-a-governance-action-before-submission-giving-stakeholders-time-to-provide-feedback \"Direct link to Optionally, authors can consider socialising their idea for a governance action before submission, giving stakeholders time to provide feedback.\")\n\n## Creating the Metadata File[​](#creating-the-metadata-file \"Direct link to Creating the Metadata File\")\n\nThe metadata file is critical for informing voters about the context of your proposal. It should:\n\nFor practical examples of governance action metadata, see the [**Governance Action Metadata Examples**](#governance-action-metadata-examples) section below.\n\n## Immutable Metadata Hosting[​](#immutable-metadata-hosting \"Direct link to Immutable Metadata Hosting\")\n\nTo ensure transparency and permanence, your metadata file and references should remain immutable. Here’s how to do this, starting with your metadata hosted in a GitHub repository:\n\n### 1. Host Your Metadata File in a GitHub Repository[​](#1-host-your-metadata-file-in-a-github-repository \"Direct link to 1. Host Your Metadata File in a GitHub Repository\")\n\n### 2. Obtain a Permanent GitHub Link[​](#2-obtain-a-permanent-github-link \"Direct link to 2. Obtain a Permanent GitHub Link\")\n\n### 3. Pin Your Metadata to IPFS or Filecoin[​](#3-pin-your-metadata-to-ipfs-or-filecoin \"Direct link to 3. Pin Your Metadata to IPFS or Filecoin\")\n\nPinning your metadata to IPFS or Filecoin ensures that it is stored on a decentralized network and remains available permanently:\n\nTo ensure fast and reliable access, it is recommended to use multiple different pinning services.\n\nBy following these steps, you ensure your metadata is permanently accessible and immutable, which builds trust in your governance actions by allowing all stakeholders to verify the original content using a permanent link or CID.\n\n## General Recommendations[​](#general-recommendations \"Direct link to General Recommendations\")\n\nFor all governance actions, follow these best practices:\n\n## Action Type – Specific Recommendations[​](#action-type--specific-recommendations \"Direct link to Action Type – Specific Recommendations\")\n\nThese recommendations provide additional guidance for each specific type of governance action.\n\n### Motion of no-confidence[​](#motion-of-no-confidence \"Direct link to Motion of no-confidence\")\n\n### Update committee and/or threshold and/or terms[​](#update-committee-andor-threshold-andor-terms \"Direct link to Update committee and/or threshold and/or terms\")\n\n`UPDATE-CC-01a`\n`CMTL-01a/02a/03a/04a/05a`\n`CMS-01/02/03`\n\n### New Constitution or Guardrails Script[​](#new-constitution-or-guardrails-script \"Direct link to New Constitution or Guardrails Script\")\n\n`NEW-CONSTITUTION-02`\n`NEW-CONSTITUTION-01a`\n\n### Hard Fork Initiation[​](#hard-fork-initiation \"Direct link to Hard Fork Initiation\")\n\n`HARDFORK-04a`\n`HARDFORK-01/02a/03`\n`HARDFORK-05/06/07`\n`HARDFORK-08`\n\n### Protocol Parameter Changes[​](#protocol-parameter-changes \"Direct link to Protocol Parameter Changes\")\n\n`PARAM-01/02a/03a/04a/05a/06a`\n\n### Treasury Withdrawals[​](#treasury-withdrawals \"Direct link to Treasury Withdrawals\")\n\n`TREASURY-01a/02a`\n`TREASURY-03a`\n`TREASURY-01a/02a/04a`\n\n### Info[​](#info \"Direct link to Info\")\n\n## Governance Action Submission Checklist[​](#governance-action-submission-checklist \"Direct link to Governance Action Submission Checklist\")\n\nBefore submitting your governance action, verify you have completed all the following:\n\n## Consolidated Resources[​](#consolidated-resources \"Direct link to Consolidated Resources\")\n\n### General Documentation[​](#general-documentation \"Direct link to General Documentation\")\n\n### Governance Action Relevant Cardano Improvment Proposals[​](#governance-action-relevant-cardano-improvment-proposals \"Direct link to Governance Action Relevant Cardano Improvment Proposals\")\n\n### Governance Action Metadata Examples[​](#governance-action-metadata-examples \"Direct link to Governance Action Metadata Examples\")\n\n### Tools and Tutorials[​](#tools-and-tutorials \"Direct link to Tools and Tutorials\")\n\n### Other Governance Resources[​](#other-governance-resources \"Direct link to Other Governance Resources\")\n\n## Key Takeaways[​](#key-takeaways \"Direct link to Key Takeaways\")",
