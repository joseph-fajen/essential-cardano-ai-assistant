Unlike tokens on other blockchains that rely on smart contracts, Cardano's native assets are integrated into the protocol itself, enabling efficient creation, transfer, and management of both fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Native assets are identified by a unique combination of two onchain properties called **Policy Id** and **Asset Name**, which ensure secure and decentralized token operations.\n\nNative assets are versatile, supporting a wide range of use cases, such as digital collectibles, tokenized real-world assets, stablecoins, and governance tokens. Tokens' metadata are additional data which describe assets’ properties, such as name, description, image or website and play a critical role in making these assets usable and interoperable across wallets, marketplaces, and decentralized applications (dApps).\n\n## Role of Metadata in Native Assets[​](#role-of-metadata-in-native-assets \"Direct link to Role of Metadata in Native Assets\")\n\nMetadata in Cardano native assets provides contextual information that enhances their functionality and user experience. For example, metadata for an NFT might include its artwork, creator details, or rarity attributes, while metadata for a fungible token might specify its ticker symbol or decimal precision. Metadata ensures that third-party tools, such as wallets and explorers, can interpret and display asset information correctly.\n\nCardano supports two primary metadata standards for **fungible tokens** (FT):\n\nThese standards cater to different needs, balancing factors like cost, flexibility, and decentralization. The choice of standard depends on the asset’s requirements, such as whether metadata needs to be static or updatable, and whether off-chain or on-chain storage is preferred.\n\nFind out more about these two standards in the following links:\n\n## Why Metadata Standards Matter[​](#why-metadata-standards-matter \"Direct link to Why Metadata Standards Matter\")\n\nStandardized metadata ensures interoperability and consistency across the Cardano ecosystem. By adhering to established standards like CIP-26 or CIP-68, developers can ensure that their assets are recognized and correctly displayed by wallets, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and NFT marketplaces. These standards also facilitate trust and usability by providing a predictable structure for metadata, making it easier for developers and users to interact with native assets.\n\nIn the following sections, we explore the specifics of CIP-26 and CIP-68, including their structures, use cases, and trade-offs, to help developers choose the right standard for their projects.",
