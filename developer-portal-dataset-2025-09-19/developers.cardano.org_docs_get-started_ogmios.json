It offers a WebSockets API that enables local clients to speak [Ouroboros' mini-protocols](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-network/tree/master/docs/network-spec) via JSON/RPC.\n\nOgmios doesn’t do much more than what the node itself does. It’s pretty much as low-level as things can get with the Cardano network. For many applications, this is too low in the abstraction layer and they would be better off using higher-level services like [cardano-graphql](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-graphql), [Rosetta](https://www.rosetta-api.org), or [Blockfrost](https://blockfrost.io).\n\n## Installation[​](#installation \"Direct link to Installation\")\n\nThe easiest way to get started with Ogmios is to use [docker](https://www.docker.com). Since Ogmios requires the presence of a Cardano node, it makes sense to use docker-compose to orchestrate both services. A compose file is available on the Ogmios repository, get it via:\n\n`git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/ogmios.git  \ncd ogmios`\n\nThen, start the components stack using:\n\n`docker-compose up`\n\nIf you prefer to build everything from source or without docker, please head to [the Ogmios website](https://ogmios.dev/getting-started).\n\n## Dashboard[​](#dashboard \"Direct link to Dashboard\")\n\nYou should now be able to access the dashboard on <http://localhost:1337> with a real-time visualization of some of the server runtime metrics.\n\n![img](/assets/images/1-dashboard-a88e9c20ebce337a2405489995224800.gif)\n\n![img](/assets/images/1-dashboard-a88e9c20ebce337a2405489995224800.gif)\n\n## Query metrics[​](#query-metrics \"Direct link to Query metrics\")\n\nThe dashboard is powered by JSON responses served by <http://localhost:1337/health>.\n\n`curl -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:1337/health`\n`wget --header='Accept: application/json' -qO- http://localhost:1337/health`\n\nJSON response:\n\n`{  \n \"metrics\": {  \n \"totalUnrouted\": 1,  \n \"totalMessages\": 30029,  \n \"runtimeStats\": {  \n \"gcCpuTime\": 1233009354,  \n \"cpuTime\": 81064672549,  \n \"maxHeapSize\": 41630,  \n \"currentHeapSize\": 1014  \n },  \n \"totalConnections\": 10,  \n \"sessionDurations\": {  \n \"max\": 57385,  \n \"mean\": 7057,  \n \"min\": 0  \n },  \n \"activeConnections\": 0  \n },  \n \"startTime\": \"2021-03-15T16:16:41.470782977Z\",  \n \"lastTipUpdate\": \"2021-03-15T16:28:36.853115034Z\",  \n \"lastKnownTip\": {  \n \"hash\": \"c29428f386c701c1d1ba1fd259d4be78921ee9ee6c174eac898245ceb55e8061\",  \n \"blockNo\": 5034297,  \n \"slot\": 15520688  \n },  \n \"networkSynchronization\": 0.99,  \n \"currentEra\": \"Mary\"  \n}`\n\n## Ogmios documentation[​](#ogmios-documentation \"Direct link to Ogmios documentation\")\n\nTo dive further into Ogmios and how to interact with the Ouroboros mini-protocols, visit [ogmios.dev](https://ogmios.dev/mini-protocols).",
