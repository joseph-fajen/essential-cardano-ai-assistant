Just a fun black magic proof of concept that lets you design some interesting Dapps that\nsimply are not possible without global state.\n\n## Global State utilizing the account component of our hybrid UTxO / Account based ledger[​](#global-state-utilizing-the-account-component-of-our-hybrid-utxo--account-based-ledger \"Direct link to Global State utilizing the account component of our hybrid UTxO / Account based ledger\")\n\nYou can use a stake script to store 1 bit of \"global state\", so you can use a list of `n` stake scripts to store `n` bits of global state. Scripts must be executed for register\nand deregister in Conway (right now only deregistration requires script execution, registration can be done by anyone) so you can use the scripts to enforce conditions on the\ntransition of the global state (the n bit sequence). All the stake scripts controlling the registration and deregistration for the stake credentials associated with the `n` bits\nof global state must defer their logic to a single independent stake validator that is responsible for validating transitions of the global state (determining whether a given user\ntransaction that registers / deregisters some number of the stake scripts ie flips some number of the bits is valid). This validator manages the global state.\n\n`n`\n`n`\n`n`\n\nFor a simple 1 bit example:\n\nWe design a smart contract that succeeds if the number of DEX orders processed in the given block is even and fails if it is odd. In this case the global state is just 1\nboolean that tracks whether the current number of genius yield orders processed is even or odd. We enforce that all orders are counted by adding new validation logic the to the DEX\norder minting contract that enforces either a register or deregister of that stake credential occurs in the tx (ie we enforce the bit is flipped).\n\nFor the 1 bit example above checking is trivial:\n\nTwo redeemers:\nRegister and deregister\nConstruction 1 tx with each redeemer transactions; submit those two tx at the same time\nThe branch for register controls the validator logic if the number of orders is even and deregister controls the logic if the number of orders is odd\nSince we know the bit is either set or not set, one of those two tx will go through (make sure both tx contain a common input so both can’t go through)\nFor the n bit sequence we use the final bit to store a lock. If the final bit is set, none of the other bits can be modified. You can extend this locking by adding locks to control specific subsequences of bits instead of the whole bit sequence.\n\nYou can check if a lock is set without flipping it by using delegate (instead of deregister which flips it)\nDelegate can only be done if the script is registered (ie bit is set).\n\nBenchmarked a bit sequence of 36.\nThe benchmark was for a simple global state validator where the bit set is used to store a counter of total transactions with a minting policy, where each bit set represents 1 unique tx that executed the minting policy in the block. The mint policy just enforces that atleast one of the stake credentials in the list is registered in the tx (ie atleast one bit gets set).\n\nIn practice, working with the bit set as an integer is very hard. Because it reintroduces concurrency issues.\nWhen you set bits, you can just submit n of the same transactions that only differ in that they at different bits, and exactly one will go through. When you try start working with the bit set as an integer, then each user tx has to change a large chunk of the bit sequence. That means you have to submit a huge number of transactions to account for the possible permutations of the bits you are trying to modify.\n\nThat’s why our naive implementation uses the bit set to represent integers as sum of bits (36 bits allows a global state integer with the max value of 36). We're sure the community will be able to figure out unique ways to do other operations and mutate the state more efficiently.\nWe worked on this with the intention of demonstrating the value of expanding the account model component of our hybrid ledger. We hope to get the developer community and ledger team to see the practical utility of such expansion to support payment on demand global state in the same way the withdraw zero trick got them to see the value of script execution not correlated to ledger actions.\nThis all works because any number of independent transactions can operate on the same reward account (staking script) in the same block (register deregister and other operations)",
