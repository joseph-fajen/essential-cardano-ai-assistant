Cardano is known for its strong foundations in security and scalability, but one big issue stands out: developers don’t have enough open, production-ready code to learn from and build on.\n\nThat’s the gap we’re trying to close. The goal is to provide the Cardano community with open-source smart contract libraries that are practical, reliable, and production-grade. More than just snippets, these libraries reflect best practices in contract design, security, testing, and optimization. They’re meant to be composable building blocks, helping developers move faster, avoid common pitfalls, and focus energy where it really matters: building great DApps.\n\nProduction Grade dApp in this list include:\n\n**[Merkle Tree Contracts](/docs/smart-contracts/smart-contract-languages/plutarch/production-grade-dapps/merkle-tree)**: Enhance data integrity verification and enable swift proof checks in extensive datasets.\n\n**[Single Asset Staking Contracts](/docs/smart-contracts/smart-contract-languages/plutarch/production-grade-dapps/single-asset-staking)**: Simplify the staking process, allowing for collective asset staking and reward distribution.\n\n**[Linear Vesting Contracts](/docs/smart-contracts/smart-contract-languages/plutarch/production-grade-dapps/linear-vesting)**: Offer secure, customizable parameters for linear asset vesting.\n\n**[Bridge Contracts](/docs/smart-contracts/smart-contract-languages/plutarch/production-grade-dapps/bridge-template)**: Enable seamless asset and data transfers across different blockchain networks, enriching the Cardano ecosystem's interoperability.\n\n**[Yield Farming Contracts](/docs/smart-contracts/smart-contract-languages/plutarch/production-grade-dapps/yield-farming)**: Streamline the creation and management of yield farming pools, opening new avenues for passive income generation within the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nBeyond the provision of these libraries, we are committed to ensuring their reliability, functionality, and ease of use. Rigorous testing and a user-friendly development environment, accompanied by comprehensive tutorials, guarantee a smooth onboarding experience for developers of all skill levels.\n\nBy democratizing access to high-quality, production-ready resources, we aim to alleviate the pain points currently faced by Cardano developers and accelerate the ecosystem's growth. Our vision is a community where developers can readily build upon existing achievements, innovate freely, and contribute to a more open, collaborative, and vibrant Cardano ecosystem.\n\n*These production-grade smart contract libraries are developed by [Anastasia Labs](https://anastasialabs.com).*",
