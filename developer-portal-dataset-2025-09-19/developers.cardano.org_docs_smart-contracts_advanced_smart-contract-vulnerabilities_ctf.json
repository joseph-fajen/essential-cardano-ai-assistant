The game is completely open-source and designed for developers, auditors, and security researchers.\n\n### What You'll Learn[​](#what-youll-learn \"Direct link to What You'll Learn\")\n\n### How It Works[​](#how-it-works \"Direct link to How It Works\")\n\nEach level presents a vulnerable smart contract with a sample interaction. Your goal is to:\n\nChallenges progress from basic to advanced, covering the most critical smart contract security issues on Cardano.\n\n### Get Started[​](#get-started \"Direct link to Get Started\")\n\n**Repository**: [cardano-ctf](https://github.com/Invariant-0/cardano-ctf)\n\n**Community**: Join the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/5XVW2MUdWu) to discuss solutions and get help.\n\n**Hints & Solutions**: Need a nudge in the right direction?
