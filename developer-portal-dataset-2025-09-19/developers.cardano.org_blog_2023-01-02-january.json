I met Juliane Montag and Roberto Carlos Morano during Fund 1 of Project Catalyst, and we founded Gimbalabs with a Fund 2 Catalyst proposal.\n\nBefore getting into this work, I taught high school in New York City, and I trained teachers at [BetterLesson](https://betterlesson.com/) and [MIND Research Institute](https://www.mindresearch.org/).\n\n***Can you tell us more about Gimbalabs and the problems you are addressing?***\n\nGimbalabs is building community spaces, technical infrastructure, educational programming, and open-source code, making it more likely that Cardano will actually change the world.\n\nWe know that the potential of Cardano is exciting, but the world won't change just because some new technology exists. We founded Gimbalabs because we want to increase the likelihood that the ideals of Cardano will happen.\n\nTo start, we focused on two things: technical infrastructure and developer education. Our technical infrastructure is called Dandelion. We provide education through \"Project Based Learning\" (PBL) courses. Along the way, we have created a community where people meet, and projects are launched.\n\nOur goal is to build systems as robust as the Cardano protocol. A network requires infrastructure and people who know how to use it to be robust and resilient. We are building Dandelion so that anyone can deploy critical infrastructure for interacting with the Cardano protocol. We are building Project-Based Learning courses so that people get first-hand experience using Cardano and sharing decision-making power.\n\n***Dandelion: Free and open, distributed infrastructure***\n\nCurrently, there are nearly 3000 active stake pools securing Cardano Mainnet. However, to build anything useful on Cardano, developers need ways to gather information from the blockchain (for example, through GraphQL, Koios, or Blockfrost APIs) or to submit valid transactions (with the Submit API). These APIs represent potential points of failure.\n\nIf people can't query it freely or submit transactions, it will not matter how decentralized the Cardano protocol is. Our goal is for the Cardano API layer to be as distributed and resilient as the Cardano network.\n\nWe have provided Dandelion as a free service to the Cardano developer community for over two years. It provides a resilient, open-source API layer that anyone can deploy, and we are currently building an incentive model for operators to run public Dandelion nodes.\n\nAnyone can review the Dandelion repository on GitLab: <https://gitlab.com/gimbalabs/dandelion/kustomize-dandelion>\n\n***Project-Based Learning: So people can learn by doing***\n\nIn everything we do, we recognize that people need more than technical know-how to use Cardano to its full potential. We need new mental models, new workflows, and new ways of organizing work - to name just a few problems of practice. When people learn by doing, they are more likely to become agents of change.\n\nPBL aims to help people become Contributors to real projects building on Cardano. The Gimbalabs PBL Framework consists of five stages, and we ask an essential question at each step:\n\nGimbalabs always takes a holistic approach to Cardano education. In \"Plutus PBL\", we cover more than Plutus. We support developers to understand the UTxO model, conceptually what a Validator does, and see how a Plutus Contract works in the context of a full-stack Dapp. Participants learn by working through hands-on projects designed to provide insights into new design patterns and challenges in DApp development. We create pathways into contribution so that developers can build their reputation, and we invite all students to decide what we do next.\n\nEnrollment is open now at <https://gimbalabs.instructure.com/enroll/3CFNFB>\n\n***So why is it called Gimbalabs?***\n\nThe early architects of Cardano have been thoughtful about naming things, and we'd like to be part of that tradition. Gimbalabs takes its name from the gimbal, a balancing device used in navigation, filmmaking, and space flight. In a boat on a stormy sea or on a camera in a shaky hand, gimbals help keep things steady.\n\nAnd gimbals are sometimes called Cardan joints/suspensions because Gerolamo Cardano is famous for describing them in precise mathematical detail. We think this is a pretty cool connection!\n\nWe combine this concept of balance with the uncontrollable scattering of the Dandelion seed: which spreads far and wide and heals the earth. We take these metaphors seriously and intend to live up to their promise. At Gimbalabs, we incubate projects, provide scaffolding for people to learn and develop new systems, pay attention to ancient patterns, and seek to empower people to see their role as actors in this world-changing moment. Then, like scaffolds at a construction site, or catalysts in a chemistry lab, we seek to get out of the way so that truly disintermediated systems can take root.\n\n***What else are you building?***\n\nWe are building a unique community by making spaces where people can think deeply and slowly as new systems emerge. We are proud to have helped many builders start bringing their ideas to life on Cardano, and we continue cultivating collaborations that lead to new projects.\n\nWe have a proof-of-concept decentralized application that (for now) is called Gimbal Project Treasury + Escrow: <https://gpte.gimbalabs.io/>. With GPTE, we are exploring a new model for how headless dapps can support communities to build independently while participating in global reputation networks.\n\nWe are hosting a book club on [Emergent Strategy, by Adrienne Maree Brown](https://www.akpress.org/emergentstrategy.html), with the expectation that these conversations will lead to new insights about the potential of community tokenomics built on Cardano.\n\nIn collaboration with other builders, we are planning additional PBL courses - and will be eager to share more on each of these as they roll out!\n\n***How can people join Gimbalabs?***\n\nGimbalabs is creating a robust and resilient global network of leaders, DevOps pioneers, builders, and educators because we know that in the hands of many, Cardano can change the world.\n\nAnyone who thinks the best way to learn is by doing something should come to say hello at Gimbalabs!\n\nThe best way to get involved is by joining a weekly meeting that interests you. We host a series of weekly meetings that provide different ways for people to get started:\n\nOur [public calendar](https://gimbalabs.com/calendar) includes the most up-to-date information, and the [Gimbalabs Discord server](https://discord.gg/XTvJBj7kzq) is a great place to stay up-to-date and to ask questions.\n\n***What's next for Gimbalabs?***\n\nThe future of Gimbalabs will only happen with you! So rather than continuing to list all the things we're excited to do, we hope you'll join one of the abovementioned meetings.\n\n***Who else are you working with?***\n\nWe are working in partnership with other open-source builders like [Mesh](https://meshjs.dev/), [TxPipe](https://txpipe.io/), [Plu-TS](https://github.com/HarmonicLabs/plu-ts) and others to create a comprehensive stack for Cardano developers. We are working alongside organisations like [OneUpOneDown](https://oneuponedown.org/), [Cardano4Climate](https://cardano4climate.com/), [WADA](https://wada.org), and [Littlefish Foundation](https://littlefish.foundation/) to launch projects and cultivate leaders globally.\n\nWe are collaborators at heart, and we've supported more projects to launch and partnerships to take root than we can count.\n\nWe always advocate for taking action by taking the first step, and we know that the best way to learn anything is by doing something. We hope you'll join us!\n\n***Where can we find more information about Gimbalabs?***",
