This month, we will focus on block explorers and pool tools. Read on to learn about the **Cardanoscan** and the **PoolTool**.\n\n## 1. Cardanoscan.io[​](#1-cardanoscanio \"Direct link to 1. Cardanoscan.io\")\n\n![title image](/assets/images/cardanoscan-8c540b6a1fe5df9f60426545f028f0e3.png)\n\n![title image](/assets/images/cardanoscan-8c540b6a1fe5df9f60426545f028f0e3.png)\n\n[Cardanoscan.io](https://cardanoscan.io/) is both a block explorer and pool tracking tool, built and operated by Cardano community member Ashish Prajapati. Cardano Scan easily lets users view recent transactions on the Cardano blockchain, explore recent blocks, and discover insightful metrics, such as the total number of active stake pools, and the total amount of ada staked on the network.\n\nOne feature that particularly stands out about Cardano Scan is the transaction visualization, which shows a graph of transactions from the last 15 days, or three epochs.\n\nIf you would like an easy and feature-rich way to explore the Cardano blockchain, then Cardano Scan is definitely worth checking out. Thank you, Cardano Scan for your efforts, keep building!\n\nFollow Cardanoscan.io on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cardanoscanio).\n\n## 2. PoolTool.io[​](#2-pooltoolio \"Direct link to 2. PoolTool.io\")\n\n![title image](/assets/images/pooltool-1f9c2437d55845d9415b83774f3aefd6.png)\n\n![title image](/assets/images/pooltool-1f9c2437d55845d9415b83774f3aefd6.png)\n\nSimilar to CardanoScan.io, [PoolTool.io](https://pooltool.io/) is a Cardano block explorer, albeit with some unique features and visualizations that make it a very interesting tool to explore.\n\nThe ‘Network Health’ section of PoolTool.io contains several useful charts and trackers which present easy-to-digest information on metrics such as community produced blocks, pool propagation times, historical block height alignment, and more.\n\nThose monitoring the Cardano network are sure to find PoolTool.io useful, so check them out if you haven’t already. Thank you for your efforts PoolTool.io, and keep on building!\n\nYou can follow PoolTool.io on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/PooltoolI).\n\n## The Cardano Developer Spotlight[​](#the-cardano-developer-spotlight \"Direct link to The Cardano Developer Spotlight\")\n\nEach month, the Cardano Foundation will be selecting a couple of interesting community-led projects to discover and share with our wider ecosystem. We hope this will encourage those who are already building solutions on Cardano to keep moving forward, while also helping to inspire those thinking of building on Cardano to get started and collaborate.\n\nIf you want to draw attention to a project, please introduce it in the [developer forums](https://forum.cardano.org/c/developers/29) under \"Cardano Projects\".",
