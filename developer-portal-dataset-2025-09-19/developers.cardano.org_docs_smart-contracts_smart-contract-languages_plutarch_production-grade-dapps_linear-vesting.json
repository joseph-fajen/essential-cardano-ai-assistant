Vesting assets to beneficiary in proportion to the elapsed time, i.e. Linear Vesting is a very straightforward and common preference. While there definitely exist more complex vesting requirements, we hope that the contract here will help those looking for something simple for their use case. Or serve as a reference for those who want to build more elaborate arrangements.\n\nThe source code for these dApps can be found [here](https://github.com/Anastasia-Labs/linear-vesting).\n\n## Key Features[​](#key-features \"Direct link to Key Features\")\n\n### Script[​](#script \"Direct link to Script\")\n\n`pvalidateVestingScript :: Term s (PVestingDatum :--> PVestingRedeemer :--> PScriptContext :--> PUnit)`\n\nThe linear vesting validator is not a parameterized one. All its customization needs are fulfilled by the datum (`VestingDatum`) of the locked UTxO.\n\n`VestingDatum`\n\n### VestingDatum[​](#vestingdatum \"Direct link to VestingDatum\")\n\nThis data structure holds the details of the vesting arrangement, including the beneficiary's address, the asset class of the tokens being vested, the total quantity of tokens, the start and end of the vesting period, the earliest point at which tokens can be unlocked, and the total number of installments.\n\n`data VestingDatum = VestingDatum  \n { beneficiary :: Address  \n , vestingAsset :: AssetClass  \n , totalVestingQty :: Integer  \n , vestingPeriodStart :: Integer  \n , vestingPeriodEnd :: Integer  \n , firstUnlockPossibleAfter :: Integer  \n , totalInstallments :: Integer  \n }`\n\n### VestingRedeemer[​](#vestingredeemer \"Direct link to VestingRedeemer\")\n\nA single UTxO at the validator address corresponds to a single vesting arrangement. There can be multiple such UTxOs present there to facilitate multiple vestings. A single vesting UTxO can however only release tokens of a single Fungible Token, specified by `vestingAsset` field.\n\n`vestingAsset`\n\nAfter `firstUnlockPossibleAfter` and before `vestingPeriodEnd`, beneficiary can claim the vested asset in proportion to the time that has passed after `vestingPeriodStart`. The remaining assets needs to be sent back to the validator address with the original datum intact otherwise the validation will fail. This spending tx requires `PartialUnlock` redeemer.\n\n`firstUnlockPossibleAfter`\n`vestingPeriodEnd`\n`vestingPeriodStart`\n`PartialUnlock`\n`data VestingRedeemer  \n = PartialUnlock  \n | FullUnlock`\n\nAfter the `vestingPeriodEnd`, beneficiary can claim the entire remaining balance at the UTxO using `FullUnlock` redeemer.\n\n`vestingPeriodEnd`\n`FullUnlock`\n\nAn important thing to note about the validator is that it only allows one script input to be spent in a single tx. Allowing more than one script input to be spent within it, could result in a critical vulnerability in the form of [Double Satisfaction Attack](https://plutus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/writing-scripts/common-weaknesses/double-satisfaction.html?highlight=double#unique-outputs) by spending two vesting UTxOs with the exact datum.\n\n## Offchain Implementation[​](#offchain-implementation \"Direct link to Offchain Implementation\")\n\nYou can find the entire offchain implementation complimenting this dApp [here](https://github.com/Anastasia-Labs/linear-vesting-offchain).",
