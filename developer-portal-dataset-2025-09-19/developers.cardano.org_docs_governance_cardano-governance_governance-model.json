This model is detailed in [CIP-1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-1694/README.md), which outlines a framework for governance through a tricameral model and a structured decision-making process via seven different types of [governance actions](/docs/governance/cardano-governance/governance-actions). A governance action is a transaction-triggered on-chain event with a time-limited window for execution.\n\n### Ada Holders[​](#ada-holders \"Direct link to Ada Holders\")\n\nAda holders are at the core of Cardano’s governance, wielding critical voting power and the ability to shape the blockchain's future:\n\n`dRepDeposit`\n`govActionDeposit`\n\nTheir active involvement ensures that governance remains decentralized and aligned with the interests of the broader community. Each associated stake key can issue two types of delegation certificates, one for a delegation to a stake pool and the other for a delegation to a DRep.\n\n### Delegated Representatives (DReps)[​](#dreps \"Direct link to Delegated Representatives (DReps)\")\n\nDReps will serve as officials representing Ada holders in the governance system. Every ada holder has the choice to either register themselves as a DRep to represent themselves or others or delegate their voting power to a DRep of their choice. Their primary roles include:\n\n### Stake Pool Operators (SPOs)[​](#spos \"Direct link to Stake Pool Operators (SPOs)\")\n\nSPOs are fundamental to the network's operational integrity and will also play a crucial role in governance by:\n\n### Constitutional Committee (CC)[​](#cc \"Direct link to Constitutional Committee (CC)\")\n\nThe Constitutional Committee will oversee and guide the governance process to adhere to Cardano’s foundational governance principles as defined in the Cardano Constitution. It will:\n\n#### Interim Constitutional Committee[​](#interim-constitutional-committee \"Direct link to Interim Constitutional Committee\")\n\nDuring the [bootstrapping phase](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-1694#bootstrapping-phase), which we will enter right after the Chang hard fork, an Interim Constitutional Committee will be established to:\n\nThe interim Constitutional Committee will have the power to change protocol parameters and, together with SPOs, initiate hard forks.\n\n## Decision Making Process[​](#decision-making-process \"Direct link to Decision Making Process\")\n\nThe governance process will involve:\n\n## Cardano's Public Testnet for Governance Features[​](#cardanos-public-testnet-for-governance-features \"Direct link to Cardano's Public Testnet for Governance Features\")\n\nIn July 2023, a public Cardano testnet named SanchoNet was announced to test all the governance features described in CIP-1694. Since then, the teams at IOG have introduced new governance features, enabling the Cardano community to gradually familiarize themselves with the novel system. SanchoNet is accessible to everyone, allowing anyone to join and test the new governance features. Additional documentation about SanchoNet is available at <https://sancho.network/>",
