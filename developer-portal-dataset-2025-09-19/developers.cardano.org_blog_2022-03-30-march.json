Lovelace Academy is a blockchain education platform to streamline your development journey with Cardano and Web3.\n\n***Hey Shweta! Happy to connect today and learn more about the Lovelace Academy platform! Can you tell us more about the platform and the problem you were addressing? Where are there gaps in the education space?***\n\nLovelace Academy is a blockchain education platform that aims to make it easier for our learners to navigate the developer ecosystem, understand key concepts and learn best practices while building on Cardano. Currently, no platforms guide newcomers on the \"Why\" and \"How\" to build on Cardano. So we are trying to be a one-stop platform to onboard people on Cardano.\n\n***What are the most important things about Lovelace Academy?***\n\nBlockchain can be a very scary space, especially if someone is from a non-technical background and wants to learn how to code. We are proud of the simple approach to teach our users about Cardano. We are a free Cardano education platform that attracts, inspires, and educates builders and visionaries to build on top of Cardano's game-changing Smart Contracts & Native Assets Platform.\n\n***Going forward, how will Lovelace Academy make an impact in the crypto space or on the world?***\n\nAdoption of Cardano beyond speculators and early adopters can be greatly accelerated by highlighting how real-world problems can be solved using Cardano's safe, elegant and powerful platform for a wide range of industries. Our objective is to create a force of developers who will build great products on top of it.\n\n***Now, what are your accomplishments so far, and what are you most proud of?***\n\nWe recently released [Learn @ Lovelace Academy](https://learn.lovelace.academy/) and got amazingly positive feedback from our users. We feel extremely proud and satisfied whenever we hear that people are using our platform and they are finding it useful. That makes all the hard work worthwhile.\n\n***Why should people choose to use Lovelace Academy? What are the advantages over other educational platforms?***\n\nLovelace Academy is a free blockchain education platform that teaches people how to build on Cardano and focuses on why they should choose Cardano over thousands of other blockchains. It focuses on end-to-end teaching in a very basic, understandable approach to even people from non-technical backgrounds.\n\n***What is the future of Lovelace Academy? For example, what new things to come, and what will it mean for the overall platform?***\n\nOur vision is to provide certification courses for users learning via Lovelace Academy eventually. This will allow them to prove that they have the said skills.\n\n***Tell us about your team. Who are the people behind Lovelace Academy?***\n\n***Thank you for your time! Do you have anything else to add?***\n\nThank you for having Lovelace Academy on Spotlight Interview. It was a great pleasure. I want to say thank you for this amazing initiative that brings projects of Cardano to the whole community.",
