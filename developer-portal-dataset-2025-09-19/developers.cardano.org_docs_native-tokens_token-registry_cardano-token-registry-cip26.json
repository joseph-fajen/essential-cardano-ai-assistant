If you intend to register any metadata for on-chain assets that exist on the publicly available testnets only (e.g. preview and preprod environments) please use the [metadata-registry from IOHK](https://github.com/input-output-hk/metadata-registry-testnet).\n\n## Background[​](#background \"Direct link to Background\")\n\nThis repository provides a means to register off-chain token metadata that can map to on-chain identifiers (typically hashes representing asset IDs, output locking scripts, or token forging policies).\n\nA [server](/docs/native-tokens/token-registry/cardano-token-registry-server) exposes the functionality of a key-value store, allowing users and applications to query registry entries through a RESTful API.\n\nWhile this registry is limited in scope to handle native tokens only, it will also serve to facilitate a discussion and introduce a standard for a metadata distribution system that is currently put forward as a [draft CIP](https://github.com/michaelpj/CIPs/blob/cip-metadata-server/cip-metadata-server.md).\n\nUse of this registry is subject to the [Registry Terms of Use](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry/blob/master/Registry_Terms_of_Use.md).  \nUse of the public API is subject to the [API Terms of Use](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry/blob/master/API_Terms_of_Use.md).\n\n## Process[​](#process \"Direct link to Process\")\n\n#### New registration[​](#new-registration \"Direct link to New registration\")\n\nNew submissions to this registry will take the form of a GitHub Pull Request with the addition of one JSON file to the [mappings/](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry/blob/master/mappings) folder. Submissions will be subject to automated checking for well-formedness and human vetting before being merged to the registry.\n\n#### Updating existing entries[​](#updating-existing-entries \"Direct link to Updating existing entries\")\n\nModification of entries in this registry require a GitHub Pull Request with the modification of one JSON file in the [mappings/](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry/blob/master/mappings) folder. Submissions will be subject to automated checking for well-formedness and human vetting before being merged to the registry.\n\n## Semantic content of registry entries[​](#semantic-content-of-registry-entries \"Direct link to Semantic content of registry entries\")\n\nEach entry contains the following information:\n\n| **Name** | **Required/Optional** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `subject` | Required | The base16-encoded policyId + base16-encoded assetName |\n| `name` | Required | A human-readable name for the subject, suitable for use in an interface |\n| `description` | Required | A human-readable description for the subject, suitable for use in an interface |\n| `policy` | Optional | The base16-encoded CBOR representation of the monetary policy script, used to verify ownership. Optional in the case of Plutus scripts as verification is handled elsewhere. |\n| `ticker` | Optional | A human-readable ticker name for the subject, suitable for use in an interface |\n| `url` | Optional | A HTTPS URL (web page relating to the token) |\n| `logo` | Optional | A PNG image file as a byte string |\n| `decimals` | Optional | how many decimals to the token |\n\n`subject`\n`name`\n`description`\n`policy`\n`ticker`\n`url`\n`logo`\n`decimals`\n\nThe policy field is optional in order to support Plutus Smart-Contracts which are not linked to a set of signing keys by default. It is used in priority if present. Otherwise, signature verification is performed using user-provided trusted keys.\n\nFor a comprehensive description of all fields and how to generate them, please see [offchain-metadata-tools](https://github.com/input-output-hk/offchain-metadata-tools).\n\n## Submission well-formedness rules[​](#submission-well-formedness-rules \"Direct link to Submission well-formedness rules\")\n\nSubmissions to the registry must consist of a single commit, directly off the **master** branch of the **cardano-token-registry** repository.\n\nSubmissions must add or modify a singular file in the [mappings/](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry/blob/master/mappings) folder. Multiple mappings should be split across multiple PRs.\n\nThe file name must match the encoded `\"subject\"` key of the entry, all lowercase.\n\n`\"subject\"`\n\nThe maximum file size of a single metadata entry is 370KB.\n\n## Use Cases[​](#use-cases \"Direct link to Use Cases\")\n\nCIP-26 is ideal for:\n\n## Pros of CIP-26[​](#pros-of-cip-26 \"Direct link to Pros of CIP-26\")\n\n## Cons of CIP-26[​](#cons-of-cip-26 \"Direct link to Cons of CIP-26\")\n\n## Summary[​](#summary \"Direct link to Summary\")\n\nCIP-26 is a practical choice for projects that need a simple, cost-effective way to attach static metadata to native assets. Its reliance on an off-chain registry makes it accessible and widely supported but introduces centralization and limits its suitability for dynamic or smart contract-dependent use cases. Developers should weigh these trade-offs when deciding whether CIP-26 meets their project’s needs.",
