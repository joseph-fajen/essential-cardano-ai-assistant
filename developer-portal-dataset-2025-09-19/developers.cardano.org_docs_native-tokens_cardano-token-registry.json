However, users may choose to register metadata mappings with a server so that applications (for example, a wallet) can query and display additional human-readable data relevant to the on-chain identifier.\n\n## New registration[​](#new-registration \"Direct link to New registration\")\n\nNew submissions to this registry will take the form of a GitHub Pull Request with the addition of one JSON file to the [mappings/](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry/tree/master/mappings) folder. Submissions will be subject to automated checking for well-formedness and human vetting before being merged into the registry.\n\n## Updating existing entries[​](#updating-existing-entries \"Direct link to Updating existing entries\")\n\nModification of entries in this registry will take the form of a GitHub Pull Request with the modification of one or more JSON files in the [mappings/](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry/tree/master/mappings) folder. Submissions will be subject to automated checking for well-formedness and human vetting before being merged into the registry.\n\n## Semantic content of registry entries[​](#semantic-content-of-registry-entries \"Direct link to Semantic content of registry entries\")\n\nEach entry contains the following information:\n\n| **Name** | **Required/Optional** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `subject` | Required | The base16-encoded policyId + base16-encoded assetName. |\n| `policy` | Required | The script that hashes to the policyId. |\n| `name` | Required | A human-readable name for the subject, suitable for use in an interface. |\n| `description` | Required | A human-readable description for the subject, suitable for use in an interface. |\n| `ticker` | Optional | A human-readable ticker name for the subject, suitable for use in an interface. |\n| `url` | Optional | A HTTPS URL (web page relating to the token). |\n| `logo` | Optional | A PNG image file as a byte string. |\n| `decimals` | Optional | The recommended value for decimal places. Native tokens are represented as whole numbers (numbers without decimals) on the blockchain. |\n\n`subject`\n`policy`\n`name`\n`description`\n`ticker`\n`url`\n`logo`\n`decimals`\n\nFor a comprehensive description of all fields and how to generate them, please see [off-chain-metadata-tools](https://github.com/input-output-hk/offchain-metadata-tools).\n\n## Submission well-formedness rules[​](#submission-well-formedness-rules \"Direct link to Submission well-formedness rules\")\n\nSubmissions to the registry must consist of a single commit directly off the **main** branch of the [**cardano-token-registry**](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry) repository.\n\nSubmissions must add or modify files in the [mappings/](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry/tree/master/mappings) folder.\n\nThe file name must match the encoded `\"subject\"` key of the entry, all lowercase.\n\n`\"subject\"`\n\nThe maximum file size of a single metadata entry is 370KB.\n\n## Server and API[​](#server-and-api \"Direct link to Server and API\")\n\nUsers and applications can query this registry through an API at `https://tokens.cardano.org/metadata`.\n\n`https://tokens.cardano.org/metadata`\n\nThe API documentation and source code for the server implementation is available with the [off-chain-metadata-tools](https://github.com/input-output-hk/offchain-metadata-tools).\n\nUse of the `https://tokens.cardano.org/metadata` API is subject to the [API Terms of Use](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry/blob/master/API_Terms_of_Use.md).\n\n`https://tokens.cardano.org/metadata`\n\n## How to prepare an entry for the token registry[​](#how-to-prepare-an-entry-for-the-token-registry \"Direct link to How to prepare an entry for the token registry\")\n\n### Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites \"Direct link to Prerequisites\")\n\nTo register native token mappings, it is recommended to have pre-existing knowledge about Cardano native assets. Start by reading through the [minting a new native asset](/docs/native-tokens/minting) example.\n\nAfter creating a Cardano native asset, you will need the following to proceed with the steps to generate a mapping for the registry:\n\n`offchain-metadata-tools`\n\n### Step 1: Generate the 'subject'[​](#step-1-generate-the-subject \"Direct link to Step 1: Generate the 'subject'\")\n\nTo create a new mapping, you must first obtain your metadata subject. The subject is defined as the concatenation of the base16-encoded policyId and base16-encoded assetName of your asset. In case your assetName is empty, then the policyId is your subject.\n\nFor this example, we will consider the following native asset:\n\n`baa836fef09cb35e180fce4b55ded152907af1e2c840ed5218776f2f.myassetname`\n\n`baa836fef09cb35e180fce4b55ded152907af1e2c840ed5218776f2f.myassetname`\n`$ echo -n \"myassetname\" | xxd -ps  \n6d7961737365746e616d65`\n\n`baa836fef09cb35e180fce4b55ded152907af1e2c840ed5218776f2f6d7961737365746e616d65`\n\n`baa836fef09cb35e180fce4b55ded152907af1e2c840ed5218776f2f6d7961737365746e616d65`\n\n### Step 2: Prepare a draft entry[​](#step-2-prepare-a-draft-entry \"Direct link to Step 2: Prepare a draft entry\")\n\n`token-metadata-creator`\n`token-metadata-creator entry --init baa836fef09cb35e180fce4b55ded152907af1e2c840ed5218776f2f6d7961737365746e616d65`\n\nThis creates a draft JSON file named after your subject.\n\n### Step 3: Add required fields[​](#step-3-add-required-fields \"Direct link to Step 3: Add required fields\")\n\n`token-metadata-creator entry baa836fef09cb35e180fce4b55ded152907af1e2c840ed5218776f2f6d7961737365746e616d65 \\  \n --name \"My Gaming Token\" \\  \n --description \"A currency for the Metaverse.\" \\  \n --policy policy.json`\n\nWhere `policy.json` is the monetary policy script file that hashes to the policyId.\n\n`policy.json`\n\n### Step 4: Add optional fields[​](#step-4-add-optional-fields \"Direct link to Step 4: Add optional fields\")\n\n`token-metadata-creator entry baa836fef09cb35e180fce4b55ded152907af1e2c840ed5218776f2f6d7961737365746e616d65 \\  \n --ticker \"TKN\" \\  \n --url \"https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Gil\" \\  \n --logo \"icon.png\" \\  \n --decimals 4`\n\n### Step 5: Sign your metadata[​](#step-5-sign-your-metadata \"Direct link to Step 5: Sign your metadata\")\n\nEach metadata item must be signed with the key/s used to define your asset policy. For this example, we assume only a single signing key is required to validate the monetary policy script and that all metadata fields will be signed at once with the signing key file. Please refer to [off-chain-metadata tools](https://github.com/input-output-hk/offchain-metadata-tools) for more granular options.\n\n`token-metadata-creator entry baa836fef09cb35e180fce4b55ded152907af1e2c840ed5218776f2f6d7961737365746e616d65 -a policy.skey`\n\n### Step 6: Finalize your mapping[​](#step-6-finalize-your-mapping \"Direct link to Step 6: Finalize your mapping\")\n\nThis will run some additional validations on your submission and check that it is considered valid.\n\n`token-metadata-creator entry baa836fef09cb35e180fce4b55ded152907af1e2c840ed5218776f2f6d7961737365746e616d65 --finalize`\n\nYour finalized metadata file is now ready to submit to the [cardano-token-registry](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry).\n\n## How to submit an entry to the token registry[​](#how-to-submit-an-entry-to-the-token-registry \"Direct link to How to submit an entry to the token registry\")\n\n### Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites-1 \"Direct link to Prerequisites\")\n\nTo submit a metadata entry for a native asset on Cardano, you must first follow the steps in [how to prepare an entry for the token registry](#how-to-prepare-an-entry-for-the-token-registry) and have a finalized metadata file ready for submission.\n\n### Step 1: Fork and clone the registry repository[​](#step-1-fork-and-clone-the-registry-repository \"Direct link to Step 1: Fork and clone the registry repository\")\n\n[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) your own copy of [cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry) to your account.\n\nThen clone a local copy:\n\n`$ git clone git@github.com:<your-github-username>/cardano-token-registry  \n$ cd cardano-token-registry`\n\n### Step 2: Add your metadata entry to the 'mappings' folder[​](#step-2-add-your-metadata-entry-to-the-mappings-folder \"Direct link to Step 2: Add your metadata entry to the 'mappings' folder\")\n\n`$ cp /path-to-my-file/baa83...d65.json mappings/`\n\n### Step 3: Create a commit for the submission[​](#step-3-create-a-commit-for-the-submission \"Direct link to Step 3: Create a commit for the submission\")\n\n`$ git add mappings/baa83...d65.json  \n$ git commit -m \"Your Token Name\"  \n$ git push origin HEAD`\n\n### Step 4: Make a Pull Request[​](#step-4-make-a-pull-request \"Direct link to Step 4: Make a Pull Request\")\n\nCreate a [pull request from your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).\n\nIf the pull request validations pass, your submission will be reviewed and merged to the main branch subject to the [Registry Terms of Use](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry/blob/master/Registry_Terms_of_Use.md).\nIt may take a few hours following a merge to the main branch before your entry is added to the database and available via the api query.",
