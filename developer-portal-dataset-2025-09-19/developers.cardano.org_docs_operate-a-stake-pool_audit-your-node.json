It works on various types of Cardano installation (CNODE Guild Operatos, Coincashew, others...).\nConfiguration files and services are parsed and analysed by the script :\n\n**Cardano compliance**\n\n**Security and system checks**\n\nPlease note that this script is only intended to help you identify configuration and basic security issues. It does not guarantee that your server is fully protected.\n\n## Pre-Requisites :[​](#pre-requisites- \"Direct link to Pre-Requisites :\")\n\n1- The script is 100% shell bash. It works on Linux systems.\n\n2- cardano-node up and running. You can setup a Cardano node with :\n\n3- Several bash commands are necessary (tput, date, grep, awk, jq). A check is performed when the script starts.\n\n4- cardano-cli is also used for KES key rotate check.\n\n## How to use :[​](#how-to-use- \"Direct link to How to use :\")\n\n### Download the script and make it executable :[​](#download-the-script-and-make-it-executable- \"Direct link to Download the script and make it executable :\")\n\nThe script can be found on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Kirael12/cardano-node-audit)\n\nYou can directly download the repository from your Cardano Nodes :\n\n`wget --show-progress -q https://github.com/Kirael12/cardano-node-audit/releases/latest/download/audit-cardano-node.sh  \nchmod +x audit-cardano-node.sh`\n\n### Run the script[​](#run-the-script \"Direct link to Run the script\")\n\nThe script must be ran with sudo and the -E option, to include your environment variables.\n\n`sudo -E ./audit-cardano-node.sh`\n\nA selection menu allow you to select your Cardano installation type. You can also choose to perform Security Checks only.\nYou can then choose to export the results to a file.\n\n## Results[​](#results \"Direct link to Results\")\n\nIt takes around 20 seconds for the script to complete. You'll get information about your node and will immediately be able to check whether your configuration is good or not, and make appropriate changes.",
