This month, we will focus on pool tools. Read on to learn about the **ADATools.io** and the **Pool.pm**.\n\n## 1. ADATools.io - Cardano Holograms[​](#1-adatoolsio---cardano-holograms \"Direct link to 1. ADATools.io - Cardano Holograms\")\n\n![title image](/assets/images/adatools-f65d137ccea4965ecab18486a6f59518.jpeg)\n\n![title image](/assets/images/adatools-f65d137ccea4965ecab18486a6f59518.jpeg)\n\nIn the spotlight this month is [ADATools.io](http://adatools.io), and specifically its Cardano Network Hologram feature. ADATools.io is a website and pool explorer dedicated to tracking and aggregating staking and delegation data, blocks and transactions, and providing staking calculators for Cardano users.\n\nADATools.io had a very interesting feature that we think really helped visualize where Cardano stake pools are located across the globe. Called the ‘Network Hologram’, ADATool’s interactive 3D holo-globe let users explore pool locations and sizes, as well as showing the number of active pools and relays worldwide.\n\nThank you, ADATools.io for your efforts, keep building!\n\n## 2. [Pool.pm](https://pool.pm/)[​](#2-poolpm \"Direct link to 2-poolpm\")\n\n![title image](/assets/images/poolpm-3fb7beb60cc9c644dc99f3e5925d0efa.png)\n\n![title image](/assets/images/poolpm-3fb7beb60cc9c644dc99f3e5925d0efa.png)\n\nThe next on our radar this month is [Pool.pm](https://pool.pm/), a fun way to visualize transactions happening on the Cardano blockchain in real-time. Pool.pm uses images of dolphins, whales, and sharks to show how large transactions are, with the largest on-chain transactions represented as humpback whales.\n\n[Pool.pm](https://pool.pm/), also shows movements to and from public stake pools alongside pool tickers, as well as transactions from major Cardano ecosystem entities.\n\nFor developers and interested parties who want to track flows of ada (₳) in real-time, Pool.pm is a great resource. Thank you, Pool.pm for your efforts, keep building!\n\nYou can follow Pool.pm on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/pool_pm?lang=en-gb).\n\n## The Cardano Developer Spotlight[​](#the-cardano-developer-spotlight \"Direct link to The Cardano Developer Spotlight\")\n\nEach month, the Cardano Foundation will be selecting a couple of interesting community-led projects to discover and share with our wider ecosystem. We hope this will encourage those who are already building solutions on Cardano to keep moving forward, while also helping to inspire those thinking of building on Cardano to get started and collaborate.\n\nIf you want to draw attention to a project, please introduce it in the [developer forums](https://forum.cardano.org/c/developers/29) under \"Cardano Projects\".",
