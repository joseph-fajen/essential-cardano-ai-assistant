It is designed for second year computing students in Nottingham, but the lectures are also made available on [YouTube](http://tinyurl.com/haskell-notts2).\n\nThe course is based on part II of [Programming in Haskell](http://people.cs.nott.ac.uk/pszgmh/pih.html).  \nIt is recommended for following the course, to purchase the below textbook, watch the youtube videos, slides are provided below to follow along, and then to try out to programming examples with resources below as well.   \nAll resources and links are provided at the bottom of the page.  \n  \nAll credit goes to the [Graham Hutton](https://people.cs.nott.ac.uk/pszgmh/), University of Nottingham\n\n## Lecture Topics[​](#lecture-topics \"Direct link to Lecture Topics\")\n\nThe course expands beyond the basics into advanced patterns, type classes, and program reasoning. Key lectures include:\n\nPlus: YouTube playlists, overview slides, Sudoku solver code, and full standard prelude reference [people.cs.nott.ac.uk](https://people.cs.nott.ac.uk/pszgmh/afp.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n## Step-by-Step Learning Path[​](#step-by-step-learning-path \"Direct link to Step-by-Step Learning Path\")\n\n### Step 1: Explore the AFP Page[​](#step-1-explore-the-afp-page \"Direct link to Step 1: Explore the AFP Page\")\n\nUse it as your central hub for videos, slides, and example code.\n\n### Step 2: Follow Lecture Sequence[​](#step-2-follow-lecture-sequence \"Direct link to Step 2: Follow Lecture Sequence\")\n\nWatch in order—each builds on the previous one:\n\n### Step 3: Read *Programming in Haskell* (Part II)[​](#step-3-read-programming-in-haskell-part-ii \"Direct link to step-3-read-programming-in-haskell-part-ii\")\n\nHighly aligns with the course. Reading alongside lectures reinforces:\n\n### Step 4: Code Along & Experiment[​](#step-4-code-along--experiment \"Direct link to Step 4: Code Along & Experiment\")\n\n### Step 5: Reason & Prove[​](#step-5-reason--prove \"Direct link to Step 5: Reason & Prove\")\n\n### Tools You’ll Need[​](#tools-youll-need \"Direct link to Tools You’ll Need\")\n\n## Best Practices[​](#best-practices \"Direct link to Best Practices\")\n\n## After This Course[​](#after-this-course \"Direct link to After This Course\")\n\nAdvanced topics you’ll be ready for next:\n\n### Lectures[​](#lectures \"Direct link to Lectures\")\n\n*Additional material:*\n\n### Resources[​](#resources \"Direct link to Resources\")\n\n\\",
