Armed with an account, you can start building your apps!\n\nBlockfrost.io uses password-less login. No need to worry about losing or storing any passwords!\n\n# Creating your project\n\nAfter setting up your account, you can now create your first project. Select **+ ADD PROJECT**, choose a suitable name, and ensure you pick the correct network.\n\n![Add Blockfrost project](/assets/images/getting-started-2_add_project-e98eafbd4d3f7f0b9724d55bb890e4ed.png)\n\n![Add Blockfrost project](/assets/images/getting-started-2_add_project-e98eafbd4d3f7f0b9724d55bb890e4ed.png)\n\nUpon clicking **SAVE PROJECT**, you will be redirected to the project subpage where a unique secret API key, known as `project_id`, will be generated.\n\n`project_id`\n\n![Get Blockfrost project_id](/assets/images/getting-started-3_get_api_key-742df3404791ebf930825fe2aaa58524.png)\n\n![Get Blockfrost project_id](/assets/images/getting-started-3_get_api_key-742df3404791ebf930825fe2aaa58524.png)\n\nProtect your secrets! Since `project_id` is a secret, ensure it is not committed to a public repository or embedded in your code. When possible, use environment variables to prevent exposing `project_id`. Ideally, set up your own application backend to store your `project_id` securely, avoiding potential leaks. Otherwise, unauthorized individuals could exploit your token.\n\n`project_id`\n`project_id`\n`project_id`\n\nIn [Blockfrost](https://blockfrost.io/), a project provides API access to a particular [network](https://blockfrost.dev/docs/start-building#available-networks). Each project is linked to a secret token known as `project_id`, which must be used to access the API.\n\n`project_id`\n\n# SDKs\n\nAn SDK, or Software Development Kit, is a collection of tools, libraries, and resources that developers use to create, build, and streamline applications for specific platforms. With support for [over 15 distinct programming languages](https://blockfrost.dev/docs/sdks), Blockfrost stands out as the most adaptable toolkit for accessing data within the Cardano blockchain.\n\nHere's a list of some of them:",
