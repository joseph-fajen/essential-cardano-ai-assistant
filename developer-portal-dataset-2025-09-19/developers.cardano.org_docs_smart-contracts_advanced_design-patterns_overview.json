Below is an overview of the key features and design patterns these libraries address:\n\n## Key Features[â€‹](#key-features \"Direct link to Key Features\")\n\n**Transaction Level Validation**: Abstracts the intricacies of spending validator validation through:\n\n**Input/Output Indexing with Redeemers**: Simplifies the management of input/output indexing, streamlining the process of associating redeemers with their respective inputs or outputs.\n\n**Strict Boolean Validation Checks**: Offers a robust framework for implementing boolean binary operators, ensuring strict validation checks across Plutus, Plutarch, and Aiken.\n\n**PlutusTypeEnum Redeemers**: Introduces an efficient data encoding method for simple redeemers, utilizing Enums to minimize complexity and optimize performance.\n\n**Normalization Techniques**: Enhances data integrity and contract reliability through:",
