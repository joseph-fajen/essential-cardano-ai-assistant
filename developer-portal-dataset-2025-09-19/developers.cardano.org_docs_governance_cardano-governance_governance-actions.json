This proposal describes various types of governance actions, the voting thresholds required for their ratification, and the roles of different participants in the process.\n\n## Types of Governance Actions[​](#types-of-governance-actions \"Direct link to Types of Governance Actions\")\n\n## Eligibility for Voting[​](#eligibility-for-voting \"Direct link to Eligibility for Voting\")\n\nThe governance model described in CIP-1694 involves three primary roles:\n\n## Voting Thresholds and Participants[​](#voting-thresholds-and-participants \"Direct link to Voting Thresholds and Participants\")\n\nThe table below outlines the voting thresholds and which roles participate in each type of governance action:\n\n| Governance Action | SPOs | DReps | CC | Voting Threshold |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Motion of No-Confidence | ✓ | ✓ | x | Majority of DReps and SPOs |\n| New Constitutional Committee and/or Threshold/Terms | ✓ | ✓ | x | Majority of DReps and SPOs |\n| Update to the Constitution or Proposal Policy | x | ✓ | ✓ | Majority of DReps and CC |\n| Hard-Fork Initiation | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Majority of all three roles |\n| Protocol Parameter Changes | x | ✓ | ✓ | Majority of DReps and CC |\n| Treasury Withdrawals | x | ✓ | ✓ | Majority of DReps and CC |\n| Info | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | All roles can vote |\n\n### Detailed Technical Breakdown[​](#detailed-technical-breakdown \"Direct link to Detailed Technical Breakdown\")\n\n**Relevant Threshold Protocol Parameters**:\n\n`dvt_motion_no_confidence`\n`pvt_motion_no_confidence`\n\n**Relevant Threshold Protocol Parameters**:\n\n`dvt_committee_normal`\n`dvt_committee_no_confidence`\n`pvt_committee_normal`\n`pvt_committee_no_confidence`\n\n**Relevant Threshold Protocol Parameters**:\n\n`dvt_update_to_constitution`\n`threshold`\n\n**Relevant Threshold Protocol Parameters**:\n\n`dvt_hard_fork_initiation`\n`pvt_hard_fork_initiation`\n`threshold`\n`Network`\n`Economic`\n`Technical`\n`Governance`\n`Security`\n\n**Relevant Threshold Protocol Parameters**:\n\n`dvt_p_p_network_group`\n`dvt_p_p_economic_group`\n`dvt_p_p_technical_group`\n`dvt_p_p_gov_group`\n`pvt_p_p_security_group`\n`threshold`\n\n**Relevant Threshold Protocol Parameters**:\n\n`dvt_treasury_withdrawal`\n`threshold`\n\n### Restrictions[​](#restrictions \"Direct link to Restrictions\")\n\nApart from Treasury withdrawals and Info actions, a mechanism is in place to ensure that governance actions of the same type do not accidentally clash. Each governance action must include the governance action ID for the most recently enacted action of its type. This ensures that two actions of the same type can only be enacted simultaneously if they are designed to do so deliberately.\n\n### Prioritization of Enactment[​](#prioritization-of-enactment \"Direct link to Prioritization of Enactment\")\n\nActions ratified during the current epoch are prioritized for enactment as follows:\n\nNote: Enactment for Info actions is a null action since they do not have any effect on the protocol.\n\n### Order of Enactment[​](#order-of-enactment \"Direct link to Order of Enactment\")\n\nGovernance actions are enacted in the order of their acceptance to the chain.\n\n### Lifecycle[​](#lifecycle \"Direct link to Lifecycle\")\n\nGovernance actions are checked for ratification only at the epoch boundary. Once ratified, actions are staged for enactment. All submitted governance actions will either:\n\n`gov_action_lifetime`\n\nDeposits are returned immediately upon ratification or expiration. All governance actions are enacted at the epoch boundary following their ratification.\n\n### Content[​](#content \"Direct link to Content\")\n\nEach governance action will include the following:\n\n`gov_action_deposit`\n\nEach action will include elements specific to its type:\n\n| Governance action type | Additional data |\n| --- | --- |\n| Motion of no-confidence | None |\n| New committee/threshold | Set of verification key hash digests (members to be removed), map of new members and their terms, new `threshold` value |\n| Update to the Constitution or proposal policy | Anchor to the Constitution and an optional script hash of the proposal policy |\n| Hard-fork initiation | The new (greater) major protocol version |\n| Protocol parameters changes | The values of the changed parameters |\n| Treasury withdrawal | Map from stake credentials to a positive number of Lovelace |\n| Info | None |\n\n`threshold`\n\nNote: The new major protocol version must be exactly one greater than the current version. No duplicate committee members are allowed; each credential pair must be unique.\n\nEach accepted governance action will be assigned a unique identifier (governance action ID), consisting of the transaction hash that created it and the index within the transaction body that points to it.",
